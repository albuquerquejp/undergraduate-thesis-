In this introductory paper, we set the stage for the rest of this Special Issue of Ecological Economics by reviewing the main issues arising in PES design and implementation and discussing these in the light of environmental economics. We start with a discussion of PES definition and scope. We proceed to review some of the principal dimensions and design characteristics of PES programs and then analyze how PES compares to alternative policy instruments. Finally, we examine in detail two important aspects of PES programs: their effectiveness and their distributional implications. PES is not a silver bullet that can be used to address any environmental problem, but a tool tailored to address a specific set of problems: those in which ecosystems are mismanaged because many of their benefits are externalities from the perspective of ecosystem managers. PES is based on the beneficiary-pays rather than the polluter-pays principle, and as such is attractive in settings where ES providers are poor, marginalized landholders or powerful groups of actors. An important distinction within PES is between user-financed PES in which the buyers are the users of the ES, and government-financed PES in which the buyers are others (typically the government) acting on behalf of ES users. In practice, PES programs differ in the type and scale of ES demand, the payment source, the type of activity paid for, the performance measure used, as well as the payment mode and amount. The effectiveness and efficiency of PES depends crucially on program design. © 2008.","Conservation; Ecosystem services; Incentive mechanisms; Payments for environmental services","conservation; ecological economics; ecosystem service; environmental economics; incentive",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43049159538

To date, however, few efforts have been made to systematically compare PES experiences. Drawing on the wealth of case studies in this Special Issue, we synthesize the information presented, according to case characteristics with respect to design, costs, environmental effectiveness, and other outcomes. PES programs often differ substantially one from the other. Some of the differences reflect adaptation of the basic concept to very different ecological, socioeconomic, or institutional conditions; others reflect poor design, due either to mistakes or to the need to accommodate political pressures. We find significant differences between user-financed PES programs, in which funding comes from the users of the ES being provided, and government-financed programs, in which funding comes from a third party. The user-financed programs in our sample were better targeted, more closely tailored to local conditions and needs, had better monitoring and a greater willingness to enforce conditionality, and had far fewer confounding side objectives than government-financed programs. We finish by outlining some perspectives on how both user- and government-financed PES programs could be made more effective and cost-efficient. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We devote special emphasis to institutional and political economy issues, which have been somewhat neglected in the literature on PES. We argue that the Coasean and pure market approach dominating the conceptualization of PES in the literature cannot be easily generalized and implemented in practice. By contrast, taking into account complexities related to uncertainty, distributional issues, social embeddedness, and power relations permits acknowledging the variety of contexts and institutional settings in which PES operate. The alternative approach presented in this introductory article to the special section may be more appealing to PES practitioners, since while avoiding restrictive and prescriptive standpoints, it allows some key sources of complexities they usually deal with on the ground to be more easily understood. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Many broader, empiricist definitions fail to distinguish PES from the larger generic family of positive environmental incentives, thus eroding their meaning by excessive vagueness. Arguably, PES definitions should focus on describing a functional tool, rather than normatively integrating desirable PES outcomes. A modified narrow PES definition is proposed, outlining conditionality as the single defining feature, avoiding the buyer-seller terms, and linking PES to offsite externalities.

However, poverty effects need to be analysed in a conceptual framework looking not only at poor service providers, but also at poor service users and non-participants. Effects on service users are positive if environmental goals are achieved, while those on non-participants can be positive or negative. The various participation filters of a PES scheme contain both pro-poor and anti-poor selection biases. Quantitative welfare effects are bound to remain small-scale, compared to national poverty-alleviation goals. Some pro-poor interventions are possible, but increasing regulations excessively could curb PES efficiency and implementation scale, which could eventually harm the poor. Prime focus of PES should thus remain on the environment, not on poverty. © 2008 Cambridge University Press 2008.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43049177016

However, lack of spatial differentiation in the targeting mechanism may lead to efficiency losses. Addressing this challenge, we construct an applied site selection tool, which takes into account three variables that vary in space: environmental services provided, risks of losing those services, and participation costs. Using data from Costa Rica's Nicoya Peninsula, we empirically test the tool's potential to increase the financial efficiency of the forest-focused PES program in place. Results show that, given a fixed budget, efficiency increases radically if per hectare payments are aligned to landowners' heterogeneity in participation costs, involving opportunity, transaction and direct costs of protection, respectively. Selecting sites based on environmental service potential also moderately increases efficiency. Overall additionality could in the best case be doubled, but remains generally limited due to current low deforestation risks prevailing in Costa Rica. To take advantage of the high efficiency potentials of flexible payments, we propose inverse auction systems as a cost-effective approach for the determination of micro-level participation costs. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Benefits were calculated from data on nearly 25,000 captures of Brazilian Atlantic Forest vertebrates, and economic costs were estimated for several restoration scenarios and values of payment for ecosystem services. We show that an annual investment equivalent to 6.5% of what Brazil spends on agricultural subsidies would revert species composition and ecological functions across farmlands to levels found inside protected areas, thereby benefiting local people.

More recently, coalitions of public and private actors have designed market-based and/or demand-led policy instruments to influence land use-e.g., eco-certification, geographical indications, commodity roundtables, moratoria, and payments for environmental services. These innovative instruments fall along a continuum of state involvement and interact with traditional public forms of land use regulation, leading to ""hybrid"" interventions. This article reviews emerging evidence on the effectiveness of the main instruments used to promote sustainable land use, and explores interactions between the new demand-led interventions and formal regulatory public policies. Although there are still insufficient rigorous studies evaluating the effectiveness of hybrid instruments, available evidence suggests some positive direct and indirect benefits. Hybrid instruments combine elements from both private and public regulatory systems, in innovative and effective ways. We propose a typology to characterize potential interactions between instruments that regulate land use. It links various types of interactions-i.e., complementarity, substitution, and antagonism-to the various stages of regulatory processes-i.e., agenda setting, implementation, and monitoring and enforcement. We give examples of governments endorsing certifications or using certification to support their own policies; governments creating enabling conditions for hybrid instruments to mature, allowing for wider adoption; and private instruments reinforcing public regulations or substituting for missing or weak governance. In some cases, governments, NGOs and corporations compete and may hinder each other's actions. With favourable institutional and governance contexts, well-designed hybrid public-private instruments can be effective. More systematic evaluation could boost the effectiveness of instruments and enhance synergistic interaction with traditional public land-use policy instruments to achieve incremental benefits as well as longer-term transformative outcomes in land-use protection. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Certification; Commodity roundtables; Deforestation; Geographical indication; Payment for environmental services; Protected area","certification; environmental policy; land use change; land use planning; sustainability; synergism; tropical region; commodity; deforestation; demand analysis; economic instrument; ecosystem service; environmental indicator; geographical distribution; governance approach; nongovernmental organization; policy strategy; private sector; protected area; public sector; regulatory approach; valuation; willingness to pay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908614963

In Bolivia's Los Negros valley (Department of Santa Cruz), bordering the Amboró National Park, 46 farmers are currently paid to protect 2774 ha of a watershed containing the threatened cloud-forest habitat of 11 species of migratory birds. In this payment for environmental services (PES) scheme, annual contracts prohibit tree cutting, hunting and forest clearing on enrolled lands. Farmer-landowners as service providers submit to independent yearly monitoring, and are sanctioned for non-compliance. Facilitated by a local NGO, Fundación Natura Bolivia, one service buyer is an international conservation donor (the US Fish and Wildlife Service) interested in biodiversity conservation. The second service users are downstream irrigators who likely benefit from stabilized dry-season water flows if upstream cloud forests are successfully protected. Individual irrigators have been reluctant to pay, but the Los Negros municipal government has on their behalf contributed ~ US$4500 to the scheme. The negotiated payment mode is annual quid pro quo in-kind compensations in return for forest protection. Predominantly, payments are made as ""contingent project implementation"", transferring beehives supplemented by apicultural training. With regard to service provision, environment committees and education programs have increased awareness in downstream communities of the probable water-supply reduction effect of continued upstream deforestation. External donors have funded subsequent studies providing basic economic, hydrological and biodiversity data, and covered PES start-up (~ US$40,000) and running transaction costs (~ US$3000 per year over the last three years). The greatest challenges in the development of the PES mechanism have been the slow process of building trust between service buyers and providers, and in achieving clear service-provision additionality. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Ecuador has two such decentralised, consolidated experiences: the five-year old Pimampiro municipal watershed-protection scheme and the twelve-year old PROFAFOR carbon-sequestration programme. We describe and compare the two cases, using a common PES definition and methodology, drawing on both primary interview-based information and secondary data. We find that both schemes have been relatively effective in reaching their environmental objectives, in terms of having probably high additionality levels and low leakage effects. A strong focus on the targeted environmental service and a strong degree of conditionality seem to be two key factors explaining these achievements. Although neither scheme has targeted poverty alleviation or other side objectives, both are likely to have improved PES recipients' welfare, mostly through higher incomes. We highlight several observations with more generalised relevance and lessons for the design of PES schemes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We establish a set of economic and institutional preconditions for PES to become a feasible and cost-effective conservation mechanism. We proceed with a macro-scale spatial analysis and overlay of opportunity costs, deforestation patterns, carbon services, and land tenure, in order to assess where these conditions hold. We then screen how the benefits of potential PES schemes might be distributed across different socioeconomic groups of service providers in different land tenure categories. Our economic-quantitative analysis, though sensitive to documented assumptions, suggests that under current carbon prices the economic preconditions are in place to pay for avoided deforestation in over half of threatened forests over the next decade. Unfortunately, the same optimism does not apply to institutional preconditions. Land grabbing, insecure tenure, overlapping claims, and lacking information on private tenure constitute real medium-term impediments to PES. If payments were to accrue to current landholders regardless of current tenure insecurities, large landowners who account for about 80% of all deforestation would reap the highest benefits, though per-capita benefits other tenure categories are also high. Schemes that closely align payments with opportunity costs are preferable for cost-effectiveness, and not necessarily more inequitable in outcomes. Essentially, PES systems cannot substitute command-and-control measures: the former depend on the latter for basic governance systems to secure effective rights of exclusion, which land stewards essentially need in order to become reliable service providers. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

People have differentiated abilities to benefit from ecosystem services, and the framework places emphasis on access to services, which may constrain the poorest more than aggregate availability. Distinctions are also made between categories of ecosystem service in their contribution to wellbeing, provisioning services and cash being comparatively easy to control. The framework gives analytical space for understanding the contribution of payments for ecosystem services to wellbeing, as distinct from direct ecosystem services. It also highlights the consumption of ecosystem services by external actors, through land appropriation or agricultural commodities. Important conceptual distinctions are made between poverty reduction and prevention, and between human response options of adaptation and mitigation in response to environmental change. The framework has applications as a thinking tool, laying out important relationships such that an analyst could identify and understand these in a particular situation. Most immediately, this has research applications, as a basis for multidisciplinary, policy-relevant research, but there are also applications to support practitioners in pursuing joint policy objectives of environmental sustainability and poverty alleviation. © 2013 The Authors.","Conceptual framework; Ecosystem services; Human wellbeing; Poverty alleviation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894826241

Since >60 % of the Brazilian people live within the Atlantic forest domain, societies both in rural and urban areas are also highly vulnerable to climate change. This review examines the vulnerabilities of biodiversity and society in the Atlantic forest to climate change, as well as impacts of land use and climate change, particularly on recent biological evidence of strong synergies and feedback between them. We then discuss the crucial role ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change might play in increasing the resilience of local society to future climate scenarios and provide some ongoing examples of good adaptive practices, especially related to ecosystem restoration and conservation incentive schemes such as payment for ecosystem services.

In theory, some appealing features should enable PES to perform well in achieving conservation and welfare goals. In practice, outcomes depend on the interplay between context, design and implementation. Inspecting a new global dataset, we find that some PES design principles pre-identified in the social-science literature as desirable, such as spatial targeting and payment differentiation, are only partially being applied in practice. More importantly, the PES-defining principle of conditionality-monitoring compliance and sanctioning detected non-compliance-is seldom being implemented. Administrative ease, multiple non-environmental side objectives and social equity concerns may jointly help explain the reluctance to adopt more sophisticated, theoretically informed practices. However, by taking simplifying shortcuts in design and implementation, PES programmes may become less environmentally effective and efficient as economic incentives, thus underperforming their conservation potential. © 2018 The Author(s).",,"Biodiversity and ecosystem functions; Design and implementations; Design Principles; Economic incentive; Non-compliance; Payments for environmental services; Social equity; Biodiversity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048400699

Here we propose a simple methodological framework to evaluate the contribution of past landscape dynamics and present landscape structure in the provision of ecosystem services. We applied this framework to a traditional agricultural landscape from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest hotspot, where natural forests cover has increased from 8 to 16 % in the last 60 years (1962-2008), and where old forests are being reduced while young forests are being regenerated. Forests of different ages, in association with current landscape structure, reveal a mosaic of forest patches under different conditions, implying different abilities to deliver ecosystem services. With the replacement of old-growth forests by young-regenerating forests and a high level of forest fragmentation, less than 1/4 of the current forest cover is able to fully satisfy the ecosystem service demands. To avoid such tendency, government policies should not only focus on increasing forest cover, but also in conserving old-growth forest fragments or increasing forest quality. The proposed methodology allows integrating historical land use and current landscape structure to evaluate ecosystem services provision and can be useful to establish programs of payment for ecosystem services. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Agricultural landscape; Atlantic Forest; Biodiversity; Corumbataí; Historical land use; Landscape dynamics; Pasture; Sugarcane",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894317900

Besides the disaster's serious human and socioeconomic tolls, we estimate the regional loss of environmental services to be ~US$521 million per year. Although our estimate is conservative, it is still six times higher than the fine imposed on Samarco by Brazilian environmental authorities. To reduce such disparities between estimated damages and levied fines, we advocate for an environmental bond policy that considers potential risks and environmental services that could possibly be impacted by irresponsible mining activity. Environmental bonds and insurance are commonly used policy instruments in many countries, but there are no clear environmental bond policies in Brazil. Environmental bonds are likely to be more effective at securing environmental restitution than post-disaster fines, which generally are inadequate and often unpaid. We estimate that at least 126 mining dams in Brazil are vulnerable to failure in the forthcoming years. Any such event could have severe social-environmental consequences, underscoring the need for effective disaster-management strategies for large-scale mining operations. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","biodiversity losses; compensation; environmental policies for mines; liability to damages; Payment for Environmental Services; rehabilitation; restoration; tailings dam failures","biodiversity; compensation system; corporate strategy; cost analysis; dam failure; disaster; environmental economics; environmental policy; environmental restoration; insurance system; liability; mining; tailings dam; Atlantic Coast [Brazil]; Atlantic Coast [South America]; Brazil; Doce River; biodiversity; Brazil; disaster; economics; mining; river; toxicity; water pollutant; Biodiversity; Brazil; Disasters; Mining; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008319837

Yet few studies have considered these risks and the ways in which restoration can increase competition for land. Here, we address this issue by examining whether large-scale restoration of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest could displace cattle production, as a result of land shortages. Although the risks of displacement are indeed high when reforestation is planned in areas with high cattle productivity, we discuss how these risks can be minimized through a combination of productivity increases, a regional restoration planning framework, and the prioritization of marginal agricultural land for restoration. We also consider how restoration can, in some circumstances, be made more economically sustainable by incorporating income-generating activities such as exploitation of timber and non-timber forest products, certification, and payments for ecosystem services. © The Ecological Society of America.",,"agricultural land; biodiversity; ecosystem service; exploitation; income; productivity; reforestation; restoration ecology; risk assessment; timber; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928940773

Of comparatively little interest for export-oriented commercial logging, they are part of a complex system of rural land use that integrates woodland management with crops and livestock. There is also evidence that woodland resources are extensively used for household consumption, greatly reducing the risk of households falling deeper into poverty as a result of environmental or economic stress. New opportunities for improving the management of miombo woodlands, with poverty mitigation in mind, suggest four policy options. First, communities are becoming more active in managing local natural resources, a result of decentralization and land reforms, which suggests that there may be good scope for strengthening related policy and legal frameworks and the measures to implement them. Second, new and integrated conservation-development approaches are emerging, which suggests possible scope for providing payments for environmental services to increase the value of managed woodlands. Third, markets throughout the region are developing and expanding, which suggests great scope for enhancing forest-based markets by removing restrictive legislation and by supporting local producers and forest enterprises. Fourth, all these opportunities suggest that public forest institutions can be revitalized by strengthening their service delivery orientations, with poverty mitigation as a main objective. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84155161196

Water quality, quantity and seasonal flow have thus also become environmental services with potential monetary value. Yet, currently the region's pioneer PES schemes are not paying for measured environmental services, but for proxy land uses thought to provide the(se) service(s). Hydrological modeling makes explicit the tacit causal relationships and tests underlying assumptions. Ideally, when combined with an economic analysis of land-use alternatives, this could inform decision makers on how much to pay for different interventions in different spatial locations. This paper focuses on two Andean watersheds: Moyobamba (Peru) and Pimampiro (Ecuador). In the first case, a municipal water company is preparing a payment for environmental services (PES) scheme to reduce upstream sediment loads. In the second, a similar conservation-oriented municipal PES scheme has operated since 2000, but the hydrological linkages have never been tested. Applying the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), we identify in both watersheds biophysically critical areas for service delivery, and compare services for current land uses with change scenarios: deforestation, reforestation, live barriers, and agroforestry. We then use the ECOSAUT optimization model to predict net economic benefits for service providers. In Moyobamba, switching to shade-grown coffee would halve sediment yields, and increase significantly farmers' economic benefits. This requires high up-front investment, but the willingness to pay of water users in Moyobamba town may suffice to cover the upfront costs. In Pimampiro, resumed deforestation would increase sediments by >50% and reduce dry-season flow by 0.5%, thus reinforcing the rationale of the existing PES scheme, focused on conserving native forests and grasslands. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the effectiveness of CFM at reducing deforestation from 2000 to 2010 in Madagascar. To control for factors confounding impact estimates, we used statistical matching. We also contrasted the effects of CFM by whether commercial use of forest resources is allowed or not. We cannot detect an effect, on average, of CFM compared to no CFM, even when we restricted the sample to only where information suggests effective CFM implementation on the ground. Likewise, we cannot detect an effect of CFM where commercial use of natural resources is allowed. However, we can detect a reduction in deforestation in CFM that does not permit commercial uses, compared to no CFM or CFM allowing commercial uses. Our findings suggest that CFM and commercial use of forest resources are not guarantees of forest conservation and that differentiating among types of CFM is important. © 2015 The Authors.","Community Forest Management; Deforestation; Impact evaluation; Madagascar; Matching; Payments for ecosystem services","commercial activity; community forestry; community resource management; deforestation; ecosystem service; natural resource; Madagascar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922986699

Despite big losses for the environment, the law introduces new mechanisms to facilitate compliance and foster payment for ecosystem services (PES). The most promising of these is a market for trading forest certificates (CRAs) that allows landowners to offset their restoration obligations by paying for maintaining native vegetation elsewhere. We analyzed the economic potential for the emerging CRA market in Brazil and its implications for PES programs. Results indicate a potential market for trading 4.2 Mha of CRAs with a gross value of US$ 9.2±2.4 billion, with main regional markets forming in the states of Mato Grosso and Sâo Paulo. This would be the largest market for trading forests in the world. Overall, the potential supply of CRAs in Brazilian states exceeds demand, creating an opportunity for additional PES programs to use the CRA market. This expanded market could provide not only monetary incentives to conserve native vegetation, but also environmental co-benefits by fostering PES programs focused on biodiversity, water conservation, and climate regulation. Effective implementation of the Forest Code will be vital to the success of this market and this hurdle brings uncertainty into the market. Long-term commitment, both within Brazil and abroad, will be essential to overcome the many challenges ahead. © 2016 Soares-Filho et al.

In most cases, policymakers focus on extensively forested areas where the flows of ecosystem services between agriculture and the environment is generally characterized by massive flows of carbon and soil nutrients from forests to agriculture. In these forest margin areas the stock of primary forest is eventually exhausted and the cheap ingredients provided by nature to agriculture become increasingly scarce. At this point, policy interest generally wanes, and agriculture and the environment begin slow declines in ecosystem service exchange, often with negative consequences for rural poverty. How does one promote increased flows of ecosystem services from agricultural lands without increasing poverty when forests and soils have been depleted? Can the standard instruments, e.g., payments for ecosystem services, be effective in such situations, and if so, do the costs to society of securing these services increase? Here we focus on the flows of ecosystem services at the end of the cycle of converting primary forest to agriculture. Primary data from the Bragantina area in the southeastern Brazilian Amazon, an area cleared of primary forest decades ago, are used to characterize smallholder production systems, to describe the flows of ecosystem services into and from these systems, and to develop a bioeconomic model of smallholder agriculture capable of predicting the effects of several types of policy action on ecosystem services provided by and to agriculture, and on-farm household incomes and food self-reliance. Of particular interest is the Proambiente Pilot Program in Brazil, which uses smallholder payment schemes to induce farmers to manage land and forest resources in ways that generate more ecosystem services. Baseline results suggest that smallholder agriculture leads to a gradual loss of ecosystem services (mainly above-ground and root carbon) provided by secondary forest fallows, and that reduction in fallow age leads to reductions in plant diversity. Intensifying agricultural activities accelerates this process, but considerably increases smallholder incomes. Paying farmers for ecosystem services linked to the retention of secondary forests and the Proambiente program both increase area in forest fallow, but the latter substantially reduces farm income because of input use restrictions. In general, programs aiming to promote the production of ecosystem services should not limit farmers' choices of ways to provide them. Employment and food self-reliance issues associated with policy options for increasing on-farm stocks of carbon and plant biodiversity are also explored. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A detailed questionnaire was completed for 292 members of the local community to gauge perceptions of benefits arising from various cultural and provisioning ecosystem services (ESs; especially safe and clean drinking water) provided by the 80ha forest restoration project. A striking 94% of those interviewed wanted more ER projects in their community. Participants reported an appreciation for cultural ESs such as esthetic landscape improvement, tourism, recreation, as well as various religious, spiritual, and educational services. In addition, 87% of interviewees believed that the restoration project improved the quality of their drinking water, and 63% said they would agree to an increase in water tariffs if the proceeds were to be invested in more forest restoration. Judging from this study, investigation and subsequent communication of popular perceptions of the various benefits of ER projects could promote consensus-building and support for projects among stakeholders, and inform governmental and societal investments in restoration. © 2013 Society for Ecological Restoration.","monitoring; payments for ecosystem services; restoration assessment; restoration planting; tropical forest restoration","biome; cultural landscape; ecosystem service; environmental assessment; environmental monitoring; forest ecosystem; perception; restoration ecology; service provision; tropical forest; Atlantic Forest; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891621346

Rural residents exert pressure on the environment through farming, fishing, and forest extraction, yet conversely, protecting rural livelihoods is often the motivation for conserving large areas of threatened forest. This research examines rural settlement within the Brazilian Amazon to shed light on the drivers of on-going rural exodus and its environmental implications. Specifically, we examine the relative importance of public service provision and natural resources in determining settlement patterns along, and rural-urban migration from, eight rivers in road-less regions of the Brazilian Amazon. Data include biophysical, social, and economic variables that were assessed in 184 riverine settlements along rural-urban gradients up to 740 km from the nearest urban center. Settlements were smaller upstream, and lacked key services such as schools and healthcare. We found that clustering of rural populations close to urban centers reflects the high costs of living in remote areas, despite abundant natural resources which previously justified migration to headwaters. Impeded dry-season navigability and transport costs restricted the flow of goods and services to and from remote areas, and transaction costs of trade exchange were higher upstream. A lack of school access was the main motivation for rural-urban migration and the abandonment of remote riverine settlements. A key policy implication is that while education services could provide a powerful tool to stabilize and support rural populations, delivery is challenging in remote areas and may also encourage further rural-urban migration in the longer term. Furthermore, river-dwellers in remote areas rarely visited remote urban centers, presumably because these journeys are too costly. We examine the implications of our findings for anti-poverty subsidies and payment for ecosystem services and conclude that transport costs required to receive payment could encourage further depopulation of remote areas. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Brazil; Migration; Riverine; Rural settlement; Rural-urban; Urbanization","ecosystem service; headwater; natural resource; nature-society relations; public service; rural population; rural-urban migration; subsidy system; tropical forest; urbanization; environmental impact; rural policy; settlement pattern; Brazil; Amazonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650415496

In a global context of stagnating or even decreasing public funding for biodiversity conservation, PES have the potential both to raise some new funds, and to absorb more efficiently money previously spent otherwise. The most novel and persuasive feature of PES lies in its ""businesslike"" conditional payment form, which differs from traditional conservation projects. The most promising entry point for international PES transfers for biodiversity interests seems to be to piggyback on the currently revived debate on reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD). The novel idea here would be to make agreements at the nation-state level, either bilaterally or multilaterally, and either within or outside the Kyoto framework. However, to take advantage of this opportunity, biodiversity conservation and forest stakeholders would need to be more proactive in the REDD debate than we have seen so far. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Biodiversity; Forest conservation; Payments for ecosystem services","Biodiversity conservation; Conservation projects; Ecosystem services; Entry point; Forest conservation; Global context; Payments for ecosystem services; Public funding; Biodiversity; Conservation; Deforestation; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Ecosystems; afforestation; biodiversity; ecosystem service; emission control; environmental economics; forest management; land tenure; poverty alleviation; stakeholder; transaction cost; watershed; Biodiversity; Conservation; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Energy; Forestry; Services; Surfaces; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; India; Indonesia; Nepal; Philippines; South Asia; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70649100061

Economic incentives, such as payments for environmental services could promote conservation, but deforestation often occurs on land without crucial tenure-security prerequisites. Improving the enforcement of existing regulatory disincentives thus represents an important element of Brazil's anti-deforestation action plan. However, conservation law enforcement costs and benefits have been much less studied than for conditional payments. We develop a conceptual framework and a spatially explicit model to analyze field-based regulatory enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon. We validate our model, based on historical deforestation and enforcement mission data from 2003 to 2008. By simulating the current conservation law enforcement practice, we analyze the costs of liability establishment and legal coercion for alternative conservation targets, and evaluate corresponding income impacts. Our findings suggest that spatial patterns of both deforestation and inspection costs markedly influence enforcement patterns and their income effects. Field-based enforcement is a highly cost-effective forest conservation instrument from a regulator's point of view, but comes at high opportunity costs for land users. Payments for environmental services could compensate costs, but will increase budget outlays vis-à-vis a command-and-control dominated strategy. Both legal and institutional challenges have to be overcome to make conservation payments work at a larger scale. Decision-makers may have to innovatively combine incentive and disincentive-based policy instruments in order to make tropical forest conservation both financially viable and socially compatible. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Environmental policy mix; Forest conservation; Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+); Spatial enforcement model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921734286

Yet, effective enforcement is often a precondition for alternative conservation measures, such as payments for environmental services, to achieve desired outcomes. Fair and efficient policies to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) will thus crucially depend on understanding the determinants and requirements of enforcement effectiveness. Among potential REDD candidate countries, Brazil is considered to possess the most advanced deforestation monitoring and enforcement infrastructure. This study explores a unique dataset of over 15 thousand point coordinates of enforcement missions in the Brazilian Amazon during 2009 and 2010, after major reductions of deforestation in the region. We study whether local deforestation patterns have been affected by field-based enforcement and to what extent these effects vary across administrative boundaries. Spatial matching and regression techniques are applied at different spatial resolutions. We find that field-based enforcement operations have not been universally effective in deterring deforestation during our observation period. Inspections have been most effective in reducing large-scale deforestation in the states of Mato Grosso and Pará, where average conservation effects were 4.0 and 9.9 hectares per inspection, respectively. Despite regional and actor-specific heterogeneity in inspection effectiveness, field-based law enforcement is highly cost-effective on average and might be enhanced by closer collaboration between national and state-level authorities. © 2015 Börner et al.",,"Article; Brazil; conceptual framework; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; deforestation; ecosystem monitoring; environmental economics; environmental management; environmental planning; environmental protection; law enforcement; rain forest; environmental protection; forest; human; legislation and jurisprudence; Brazil; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forests; Humans; Law Enforcement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929485285

In the present study emergy synthesis was applied to assess the environmental performance of a coffee farm located in Coromandel, Minas Gerais, in the Brazilian Cerrado. The farm produces green coffee for exportation, and holds an area with native vegetation of 80. ha, larger than that required by Brazilian legislation. The assessment of the native area within the farm was carried out in order to determine its environmental sustainability. The emergy ternary diagram was employed to interpret the results, which show that a farm with 54. ha of productive area must be matched with 200. ha of native vegetation for medium term sustainability. The Cerrado's farm production is primarily for export, and an evaluation of the environment and economic changes with respect to importing countries was performed. Emergy synthesis is proposed to calculate the price of environmental services balancing trades in the international market.

Since 1985, pastures and croplands have replaced nearly 65 Mha of forests and savannas in the legal Amazon. A growing body of work suggests that this paradigm of horizontal expansion of agriculture over ecosystems is outdated and brings negative social and environmental outcomes. Here we propose four strategies that can reduce deforestation, while increasing production and social wellbeing. First, eliminate land grabbing and land speculation through designation of public forests. This would clarify land tenure and limit the pool of land available for uncontrolled expansion of agriculture and ranching. Second, reduce deforestation on private properties by implementing existing mechanisms in Brazil's Forest Code to facilitate payments for environmental services, with support from market initiatives for sustainable sourcing of agricultural products. Third, incentivize increased productivity on medium and large properties through targeted investments. By stimulating adoption of proven technologies for sustainable intensification, this would help meet Brazil's production targets and growing international demand for agricultural products, without expanding into new production areas. Finally, foster economic, environmental and social improvements through technical assistance to small farmers. Small farmers occupy a large swath of the Amazon and often lack access to technical assistance, production technology, and markets. Providing quality technical assistance to small farmers could help them better align production practices with local opportunities; increase household income and improve livelihoods; and reduce deforestation pressure. By implementing these four strategies in a coordinated effort between public and private agents, Brazil can show the world how to reduce deforestation while increasing agricultural output, reestablishing its leadership in managing natural resources and mitigating climate change. © 2019 The Authors","Amazon; Climate change; Intensification; Sustainability; Undesignated lands","agricultural intensification; climate change; deforestation; environmental economics; forestry policy; land tenure; land use change; sustainability; Amazonia; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077865619

However, when environmental-service (ES) buyers are heterogeneous in their income and water-consumption levels, this scheme may not be optimal, as total payments might become too low and services under-supplied. This paper estimates willingness to pay (WTP) higher fees from hydrological-service buyers in an ongoing PES initiative in an Andean watershed in Colombia, where small, flat user payments have been introduced. ES users fall into two highly heterogeneous categories: smallholder peasants and recreational-house owners. We perform a contingent valuation analysis in a representative sample of 218 households. For improved water services, ES buyers on average are willing to pay monthly about US$1 premium over current flat PES rate. Users' heterogeneity, however, affects significantly this outcome: while recreational-house owners are willing to pay monthly on average US$1.61 more than the current fee, smallholders only US$0.41. Spatial variables, such as distance to the water distribution point and to the town center, importantly influence WTP. Results may help designing user-driven PES schemes in line with efficiency and equity objectives. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Colombia; Environmental services; Heterogeneous consumers; Hydrological services; Payment for environmental services; Watershed protection; Willingness to pay","ecosystem service; environmental planning; environmental protection; heterogeneity; hydrological change; watershed; willingness to pay; Andes; Colombia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857113186

Mounting empirical evidence suggests that changes in Brazilian law enforcement strategy and the related governance system may account for a large share of the overall success in curbing deforestation rates. At the same time, Brazil is experimenting with alternative approaches to compensate farmers for conservation actions through economic incentives, such as payments for environmental services, at various administrative levels. We develop a spatially explicit simulation model for deforestation decisions in response to policy incentives and disincentives. The model builds on elements of optimal enforcement theory and introduces the notion of imperfect payment contract enforcement in the context of avoided deforestation. We implement the simulations using official deforestation statistics and data collected from field-based forest law enforcement operations in the Amazon region. We show that a large-scale integration of payments with the existing regulatory enforcement strategy involves a tradeoff between the cost-effectiveness of forest conservation and landholder incomes. Introducing payments as a complementary policy measure increases policy implementation cost, reduces income losses for those hit hardest by law enforcement, and can provide additional income to some land users. The magnitude of the tradeoff varies in space, depending on deforestation patterns, conservation opportunity and enforcement costs. Enforcement effectiveness becomes a key determinant of efficiency in the overall policy mix. © 2015 Börner et al.",,"Article; Brazil; budget; conceptual framework; cost effectiveness analysis; deforestation; environmental management; environmental planning; environmental protection; forest; income; land use; law enforcement; mathematical model; probability; process model; reward; agriculture; compensation; economics; environment; environmental protection; government regulation; human; legislation and jurisprudence; statistical model; Daucus carota; Agriculture; Brazil; Compensation and Redress; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environment; Environmental Policy; Forests; Government Regulation; Humans; Income; Law Enforcement; Models, Statistical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922350004

A growing number of projects and proposals intend to reward carbon storage services. Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation is currently a key issue for negotiations on an international agreement that is to take effect in 2013. Various issues require decisions that will have substantial impacts on both the effectiveness of mitigation and the scale of Amazonia's potential role. These decisions include the effects that money generated from payments can have, the spatial scale of mitigation (e.g. projects or countries and sub-national political units), whether to have voluntary or mandatory markets, and whether these reductions will generate carbon credits to offset emissions elsewhere. It is argued that national-level programmes, combined with a national target under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, are the best solution for Brazil in terms of both capturing international funding and stimulating the major cuts in global emissions that are needed to minimize climate risk to the Amazon rainforest. The high likelihood of passing a tipping point for maintaining the Amazon rainforest implies the need for urgency in altering current negotiating positions. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","carbon; ecosystem services; environmental services; mitigation; payments for environmental services (PES); rainforests; REDD","carbon sequestration; decision making; ecosystem service; environmental economics; environmental policy; global warming; incentive; pollution tax; rainforest; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859124851

The emerging global Forest and Landscape Restoration (FLR) agenda seeks to limit global climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the growth of trees. In doing so, it may also protect biodiversity as a free cobenefit, which is vital given the massive shortfall in funding for biodiversity conservation. We investigated whether natural forest regeneration on abandoned pastureland offers such cobenefits, focusing for the first time on the recovery of taxonomic diversity (TD), phylogenetic diversity (PD) and functional diversity (FD) of trees, including the recovery of threatened and endemic species richness, within isolated secondary forest (SF) fragments. We focused on the globally threatened Brazilian Atlantic Forest, where commitments have been made to restore 1 million hectares under FLR. Three decades after land abandonment, regenerating forests had recovered ~20% (72 Mg/ha) of the above-ground carbon stocks of a primary forest (PF), with cattle pasture containing just 3% of stocks relative to PFs. Over this period, SF recovered ~76% of TD, 84% of PD and 96% of FD found within PFs. In addition, SFs had on average recovered 65% of threatened and ~30% of endemic species richness of primary Atlantic forest. Finally, we find positive relationships between carbon stock and tree diversity recovery. Our results emphasize that SF fragments offer cobenefits under FLR and other carbon-based payments for ecosystem service schemes (e.g. carbon enhancements under REDD+). They also indicate that even isolated patches of SF could help to mitigate climate change and the biodiversity extinction crisis by recovering species of high conservation concern and improving landscape connectivity. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","biomass; Brazilian Atlantic Forest; ecosystems services; endemic species richness; Forest and Landscape Restoration; REDD+; threatened","biodiversity; biomass; carbon; deforestation; ecosystem service; emission control; endemic species; fragmentation; restoration ecology; tropical forest; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Bos; animal; biodiversity; bovine; Brazil; ecosystem; environmental protection; forest; phylogeny; tropic climate; Animals; Biodiversity; Brazil; Cattle; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Phylogeny; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074790131

To illustrate how monetary values can be assigned, we discuss a project that awarded PES to silvopastoral systems in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Colombia based on carbon stocks and biodiversity. PES can promote positive environmental attitudes in farmers. Currently this project is being scaled up in Colombia based on their positive experiences with PES as a tool to promote adoption.

We aim to quantify ecosystem services derived from different land uses within the Atibainha Reservoir catchment in Brazil, determine the spatial distribution of ecosystem services and quantify the impacts of land use changes on the provision of ecosystem services. Four ecosystem services were considered: carbon sequestration, mitigation of sediment delivery into the reservoir, purification of water and maintenance of soil fertility. Results indicate strong increase in the provision of ecosystem services among the main land uses in the following order: urban area/bare soil; pastures; plantation of eucalyptus and native forests. The most important services provided by native forests, when compared with bare soil, were carbon sequestration and prevention of sedimentation, with an additional 864 569 tons of carbon stored in forest biomass in 30 years, and prevention of 244 511 tons of sediment delivery into the reservoir per year, respectively, from 7624 ha of lands around the reservoir. Spatial variation in the provision of ecosystem services were mapped to develop a tool to support decision making at the landscape scale. Results and maps from the decision support tool can support policies that ensure effective land-use planning and can serve as the basis for the development of payment for ecosystem service schemes in the region.

The global portfolio of PES programs is estimated to represent an annual investment of more than USD $36 billion. Despite this substantial investment, the continued lack of systematic and rigorous impact evaluation of PES has contributed to uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of this tool for conservation. Here, we assessed the ability of two watershed PES programs to promote native forest conservation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Those two focal programs are among the most well-established PES programs in Brazil, and form part of a larger network of PES programs intended to protect the drinking water supply of over 19 million people in the São Paulo metropolitan region. Using a counterfactual approach, we examined if enrollment in a PES program contributed to the conservation of on-farm native forest cover. With propensity score matching, we identified a set of neighboring, non-enrolled ‘control’ properties, with similar size, altitude, soil type, demographic density, presence of water sources and forest cover. We then estimated forest cover on enrolled and control properties before and after PES implementation with a differences-in-differences method, modeled as the probability of an observed change in on-farm forest area as a consequence of PES enrollment. We found that PES has a positive effect on forest cover, with PES enrollment over a five-year period associated with an additional 2.8–5.6% of farm area coverage in native Atlantic Forest, through forest regeneration. PES enrollment was associated with a non-significant trend toward decreased loss of vegetation. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding the contribution of PES to additionality in forest conservation. While positive, the relatively slow impact of PES on forest regeneration suggests that environmental managers should not count exclusively on PES mechanism to achieve conservation goals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Additionality; Atlantic Forest regeneration; Avoided deforestation; Ecosystem restoration; Environmental services; Impact evaluation","conservation management; deforestation; ecosystem service; forest cover; forest ecosystem; restoration ecology; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Sao Paulo [Sao Paulo (STT)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058648798

In Mexico, the decrees of creation of biosphere reserves state that rural communities with the right to use buffer zones must avoid deforestation and their land uses must become sustainable, a task which is not easily accomplished. The objectives of this paper are: (a) to analyze the conflict between people's livelihoods and ecosystem protection in the PAs of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas (SMC), paying special attention to the rates and causes of deforestation and (b) to review policy options to ensure forest and ecosystem conservation in these PAs, including the existing payments for environmental services system and improvements thereof as well as options for sustainable land management. We found that the three largest PAs in the SMC are still largely forested, and deforestation rates have decreased since 2000. Cases of forest conversion are located in specific zones and are related to agrarian and political conflicts as well as growing economic inequality and population numbers. These problems could cause an increase in forest loss in the near future.

We collected 288 snappers and interviewed 86 fishermen. The stomach contents of each fish were examined and macroscopic gonad analysis was performed. Snappers are very important for the fisheries of NE Brazil, and our results indicated that some populations, such as mutton snapper (L. analis) and lane snapper (L. synagris), are being caught when they are too young, at early juvenile stages. Local knowledge has been shown to be a powerful tool for determining appropriate policies regarding management of target species, and artisanal fishermen can be included in management processes. Other suggestions for managing the fisheries are discussed, including proposals that could provide motivation for artisanal fishermen to participate in programs to conserve resources, such as co-management approaches that utilize local knowledge, the establishment of fishing seasons, and compensation of fishermen, through 'payment for environmental services'. These suggestions may enhance the participation of local artisanal fishermen in moving to a more realistic and less top-down management approach of the fish population. © 2011 Begossi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Lutjanidae; Lutjanus analis; Lutjanus synagris; Lutjanus vivanus; Ocyurus chrysurus; animal; animal disease; article; Brazil; classification; diet; environmental protection; food industry; methodology; Perciformes; physiology; qualitative research; reproduction; Animals; Brazil; Conservation of Natural Resources; Diet; Fisheries; Perciformes; Qualitative Research; Reproduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952709891

Ecosystem services would be those resulting from forest conservation and regeneration and sustainable and innovative production practices. The results suggest a regressive bias when some variables that capture the income effect positively affect participation in the program and acceptance of the payment offered. There is also evidence of adverse selection when acceptance of the amount offered is more sensitive to the service provision already being suited to the modes of production adopted. The results, on the other hand, indicate that farmers' decisions to join the program depend not only on their opportunity costs, but also on their perceptions about specific issues, such as their environmental knowledge or awareness, inertia to change production modes, fear of additional monitoring, and level of understanding of the program. These results are important to support the program's outreach strategies and the design of mechanisms for the selection of beneficiaries and pricing of payments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Contingent valuation; Payment for ecosystem services; Willingness to accept payment","contingent valuation; cost; decision making; ecosystem service; environmental economics; farmers attitude; perception; service provision; willingness to pay; Brazil; Paraiba do Sul Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044376329

During the same period, soil and water conservation practices were performed in the basin, such as: building level terraces and riparian vegetation recovery. We separated streamflow into baseflow and direct runoff, then we evaluted the baseflow index that indicated that groundwater significantly contributes to total flow. Therefore, to investigate the effects on streamflow, we performed a trend analysis in the baseflow time series using the Mann-Kendall test. In addition, we analysed the efficiency of soil erosion regulation practices over time, considering the total payment and the trends found in the baseflow. Whereas precipitation records present a decreasing trend (1 mm month−1), baseflow tends to increase by 0.018 m3 s−1 in the same period. Our findings show that soil conservation practices performed in the basin increase baseflow and also provide a better resilience to endure extreme events such as drought based on an increase in forest areas and soil conservation practices such as level terrace. © 2018","Payment for ecosystem services; Soil and water conservation; Water yield","Ecosystems; Erosion; Groundwater; Historic preservation; Runoff; Soil conservation; Soils; Stream flow; Time series analysis; Conservation practices; Ecosystem services; Environmental Protected Area; Mann-Kendall test; Payments for ecosystem services (PES); Riparian vegetation; Soil and water conservation; Water yield; Water conservation; ground water; rain; baseflow; ecosystem service; extreme event; runoff; soil conservation; soil erosion; streamflow; water management; water yield; Article; Brazil; drought; ecosystem; ecosystem resilience; environmental economics; forest; precipitation; priority journal; riparian ecosystem; river basin; soil erosion; stream (river); trend study; vegetation; water conservation; water flow; water supply; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057262728

The system dynamics model of the sugarcane and ethanol production chain explores the impact of these variables to evaluate the feasibility of ethanol production. Using the VENSIM software different arrangements for sugarcane yield, gasoline prices and sales tax were simulated (horizon of 20 years). Brazil's Federal Government policy of gasoline price below the international price and the diversity of state sales tax rates produce distortions in the ethanol market and impose considerable constraints on the development of the ethanol industry. The simulations show that to ensure the feasibility of ethanol production, the pump price of regular gasoline would need to be US$1.95 per liter, which is far higher than the US$1.26 per liter currently charged. Public policies involving the liberalization of gasoline prices and the homogenization of the sales taxes on ethanol among the Brazilian states could reduce the distortions caused by these policies. These policies could contribute to reduce uncertainty in the ethanol sector and encourage technological and productive investments. Future research could add and evaluate the impacts of the environmental benefits of ethanol production and consumption (Carbon Trade Market, Payment for Environmental Services and Bioelectricity production) and of sugarcane byproducts on its feasibility. The sensitivity analysis revealed the effectiveness of the model to support policies and managerial decisionmaking process in the sugarcane ethanol sector. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Ethanol supply chain; Feasibility; Gasoline prices; Sugarcane yield; System dynamics; Tax rates","Byproducts; Carbon; Costs; Electrophysiology; Energy policy; Ethanol; Gasoline; Investments; Public policy; Sales; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; System theory; Feasibility; Gasoline prices; Sugarcane yield; System Dynamics; Tax rates; Taxation; biofuel; crop yield; ethanol; feasibility study; federal system; fuel consumption; liberalization; policy making; price dynamics; sensitivity analysis; software; sugar cane; supply chain management; tax system; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009458848

The efficiency increase is even more pronounced when opportunity costs are taken into account and payment levels are varied accordingly. We also observe that the use of the above mentioned concepts decreases the average area of the selected, sites which might indicate that the proposed approaches encourage participation of the poor.","Conservation; Costa Rica; Environmental services; Payment; Targeting","developing world; efficiency measurement; environmental protection; service provision; spatial variation; Central America; Costa Rica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845868494

These segregated high input production systems contribute to some of the world’s most pressing sustainability challenges, including climate change, nutrient imbalances, water pollution, biodiversity decline, and increasingly precarious rural livelihoods. There is substantial evidence that by closing the loop in nutrient and energy cycles, recoupling crop and livestock systems at farm and territorial scales can help reduce the environmental externalities associated with conventional commercial farming without declines in profitability or yields. Yet such “integrated” crop and livestock systems remain rare as a proportion of global agricultural area. Based on an interdisciplinary workshop and additional literature review, we provide a comprehensive historical and international perspective on why integrated crop and livestock systems have declined in most regions and what conditions have fostered their persistence and reemergence in others. We also identify levers for encouraging the reemergence of integrated crop and livestock systems worldwide. We conclude that a major disruption of the current regime would be needed to foster crop-livestock reintegration, including a redesign of research programs, credit systems, payments for ecosystem services, insurance programs, and food safety regulations to focus on whole farm outcomes and the creation of a circular economy. An expansion of the number of integrated crop and livestock systems field trials and demonstrations and efforts to brand integrated crop and livestock systems as a form of sustainable agriculture through the development of eco-labels could also improve adoption, but would likely be unsuccessful at encouraging wide-scale change without a more radical transformation of the research and policy landscape. © 2020 by the author(s).","Innovation; Integrated crop livestock systems; Mixed farming systems; Socio-technical transitions; Sustainable agriculture; Technology adoption","alternative agriculture; crop production; farm; livestock farming; production system; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083399284

So far, however, experiences and theoretical analyses of PES specifically for adaptation have not been well documented. This paper addresses this gap by analysing the opportunities and constraints of PES as an instrument for EBA. Specifically, we examine the potential for PES to address key elements for adaptation by focusing on three pathways: the user side, the provider side and institutional and societal change. In addition, we assess whether PES fulfils key requirements for adaptation policy instruments, notably effectiveness, efficiency, equity and legitimacy. We find that PES are not a panacea for all environmental services and country contexts, but can be promising adaptation policy instruments where certain preconditions are met and synergies prevail. We conclude on four points especially relevant for the practical scope for PES-adaptation synergies: (i) natural adaptation co-benefits (where the targeted environmental service serves a dual function, e.g. secured water quality and increased adaptive capacity), (ii) piggy-backing (where adaptation benefits are coincidental outcomes), (iii) adaptation-relevant institutional and sectoral spillovers from PES schemes, and (iv) direct payments for adaptation benefits. © 2011 Earthscan.","Adaptation; Ecosystem-based adaptation; Payments for environmental services","adaptive management; climate change; ecosystem service; environmental economics; environmental legislation; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857745793

The motivations of farmers to take part in PES programs, however, is still largely unknown. Most of the recent studies on the theme have investigated factors influencing participation but a few of them have looked at the factors explaining the minimum financial compensation that farmers would expect to receive to join PES. Particularly scarce are the studies aiming to understand the relationships between the minimum amount of money (MAM) that farmers would demand to get involved in PES programs for forest conservation and restoration and the impacts of such programs on PES additionality. We focused our study on the early stages of the PES program of the Chapecó Ecological Corridor, an important agricultural region that provides vital ecosystem services in Southern Brazil. One hundred farmers from 21 municipalities were interviewed. Data were tested using maximum likelihood and the model selection approach. Almost all farmers interviewed (94%) manifested interested in taking part in a PES program focused on forest conservation, but only 48% would like to get involved in a forest restoration program. PES program modality (100%), farmers’ income (65%) and educational level (54%) were the most important variables influencing the minimum amount of money required by farmers to get involved. In average, the farmers would expect 35% more for forest restoration (US$ 185.56/ha) than for conservation (US$ 116.53/ha) programs. In any case, however, the net increase of forest cover resulting from the PES program would be insignificant. Nevertheless, PES could provide some additionality by halting forest degradation and by helping to curb small-scale and illegal deforestation. The low interest in restoration activities may jeopardize the PES program goals and cause negative impact on the implementation of the National Forest Act in the region. To overcome this constraint, the PES program managers should work with the farmers to raise awareness about the relevance of forest restoration in a region with seasonal water shortages, high level of erosion and of water pollution. © 2017","Additionality; Forest conservation; Forest restoration; Mata Atlântica","compensation system; conservation; ecosystem service; environmental legislation; farmers attitude; forest management; maximum likelihood analysis; restoration ecology; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Mata Atlantica Biosphere Reserve",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021944145

This expansion faces logistical challenges, in particular identifying appropriate incentives and enrollment processes to provide additional ecosystem services under budget constraints. In Brazil, PWS programs have mostly occurred at the local level, using formulaic contracts to ensure landowners are compensated for provision of specific types and quantities of ecosystem services. However, it is unclear how these financial incentives will function as programs expand to new areas, as pilot programs report high recruitment costs. Using as an example the Cantareira System, an important drinking water supply for the São Paulo metropolitan area, we review PWS incentives in the context of factors that affect farmer land use decisions. We base our research on a review of policies affecting PWS in Brazil, existing PWS in the Cantareira region, and drivers affecting land use and technology adoption by cattle ranchers, drawing from the literature and interviews with farmers and agronomists in the study region. While financial incentives (payments) account for both the value of ecosystem services and opportunity costs of shifting pasture production to forest, several economic, social, political, and biophysical factors will likely affect landowners’ decisions to enroll in PWS. This suggests that, while PWS programs may lead to the provision of additional ecosystem services, the complexity of contracts and diversity of local conditions create challenges to broad deployment in the absence of significant outreach efforts. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity protection; Environmental compliance; Forest restoration; Participation; Payment for ecosystem services; Payments for watershed services; PES financing; PES governance; PES legislation; Water policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008386023

Incentive-based conservation policies, such as payments for environmental services (PES), are seen as promising approaches to reduce deforestation. Yet, arguably the adoption of upscaled PES programs has remained slow, and when implemented their design often diverges from the principles laid out in the theory-based PES literature. In this article, we concentrate on some political economy forces that could help explaining the gap between PES theory and practice, with respect to policy adoption, including opportunities and challenges in this process. Public policy theories grasp the adoption determinants of three large, government-led incentive programs for forest conservation in the Amazon, in Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil. We use Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework to analyze decision-making regarding program initiation, including key stakeholder interviews, to understand policy choices. We find that environmental concerns are not always the prime motives for PES programs, as political and institutional contexts limit environmental policy-makers' actions. Yet, policy choice processes become less constrained when environmental issues are closer to a government's priorities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Equity; Forest conservation; Governance; Political economy; Public policies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962198307

We analysed the implementation of a PES scheme in Acre (Brazil) by taking into account land use heterogeneity in an agricultural frontier. Justified by the modernisation of deforestation control policies, the programme promotes agricultural intensification through fire-free practices. In this way, the PES tends to focus on long-established settlements, where farmers are wealthier and the landscape is dominated by pasture. Agricultural intensification may be adapted to foster reforestation. In order to curb deforestation a specific policy is needed for targeting remote areas where initial stages of deforestation usually take place.

Methods for detecting and monitoring tropical selective logging using satellite data are at an early stage, with current methods only able to detect more intensive timber harvest (&gt;20 m3 ha−1). The spatial resolution of widely available datasets, like Landsat, have previously been considered too coarse to measure the subtle changes in forests associated with less intensive selective logging, yet most present-day logging is at low intensity. We utilized a detailed selective logging dataset from over 11,000 ha of forest in Rondônia, southern Brazilian Amazon, to develop a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm for detecting low-intensity selective logging (&lt;15 m3 ha−1). We show that Landsat imagery acquired before the cessation of logging activities (i.e. the final cloud-free image of the dry season during logging) was better at detecting selective logging than imagery acquired at the start of the following dry season (i.e. the first cloud-free image of the next dry season). Within our study area the detection rate of logged pixels was approximately 90% (with roughly 20% commission and 8% omission error rates) and approximately 40% of the area inside low-intensity selective logging tracts were labelled as logged. Application of the algorithm to 6152 ha of selectively logged forest at a second site in Pará northeast Brazilian Amazon, resulted in the detection of 2316 ha (38%) of selective logging (with 20% commission and 7% omission error rates). This suggests that our method can detect low-intensity selective logging across large areas of the Amazon. It is thus an important step forward in developing systems for detecting selective logging pan-tropically with freely available data sets, and has key implications for monitoring logging and implementing carbon-based payments for ecosystem service schemes. © 2018 The Authors","Brazil; Conservation; Degradation; Landsat; Random Forest; Selective logging; Surface reflectance; Texture measures; Tropical forests","Artificial intelligence; Conservation; Decision trees; Degradation; Drought; Ecosystems; Error detection; Learning systems; Tropics; Brazil; LANDSAT; Random forests; Selective logging; Surface reflectance; Texture measures; Tropical forest; Learning algorithms; algorithm; biodegradation; conservation management; data set; dry season; ecosystem service; environmental monitoring; implementation process; Landsat; machine learning; satellite data; satellite imagery; selective logging; spatial resolution; spectral reflectance; tropical environment; tropical forest; Amazonia; Brazil; Nia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057719718

Recently, controversial revisions to the Forest Code in Brazil have been implemented which include a reduction in the width of protected riparian buffer zones required along rivers. In order to model the impact of legislative changes on ecosystem services, we used the integrated valuation of environmental services and tradeoffs (InVEST) tool to assess a 30,000. ha watershed in southern Brazil and carbon sequestration as an indicator for ecosystem services. The results demonstrate that the adoption of improved agriculture practices, development of secondary forests and especially the conversion of land into more restrictive types of land-use has a significant and positive impact on the levels of carbon sequestered. On the other hand, the easing of riparian zone requirements shows an important potential loss in carbon sequestration. More importantly, reducing the size of the buffer zone might result in land-conversion into agriculture or pasture, impacting both carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services. However, the easing of restrictions on riparian areas under the revised Forest Code might be overshadowed by changes to Legal Forest Reserve provisions which could have a much greater impact on carbon sequestration. Despite the restrictions imposed by various pieces of legislation, the loss of ecosystem services due to a reduction in the protected riparian area, as well as possible land conversion due to changes in Legal Forest Reserves, are possible unless efforts involving narrowing the gap between research and policy, effective law enforcement, and implementing attractive payment for ecosystem services programs, are put in place. We believe that introducing incentives to farmers to maintain the protection of riparian areas by implementing agroforestry systems, such as erva-mate (Ilex paraguariensis), would be beneficial socioeconomically and ecologically and should be integrated into the Forest Code. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Agricultural incentives; Carbon sequestration; Ecosystem services; Forest management; InVEST; Riparian zones","agricultural practice; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; conservation management; ecosystem service; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; forest management; incentive; land use planning; law enforcement; policy implementation; protected area; regulatory framework; riparian zone; socioeconomic impact; trade-off; watershed; agroforestry; buffer zone; regulatory approach; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907342690

Restoration on farmland however threatens agricultural output and the livelihoods of small family farmers, leading to weak enforcement of the law and a national debate over the Code which resulted in revisions in 2012 that significantly reduced legally mandated restoration. To inform the design of effective environmental policies, we interviewed 60 typical dairy family farmers utilizing pasture-based agroecological grazing practices to assess their perceptions and knowledge of the pre-2012 Forest Code, its impacts and their willingness to comply. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) identified three distinct clusters: farmers who understood the forest code and its ecological impacts and were willing to comply; farmers who understood the ecological benefits of restoration, but were unwilling to comply; and those with little knowledge of benefits or interest in compliance.

To estimate how increasing agricultural production can be conciliated with protection of natural resources at the national scale, we analyzed current land use in Suriname, and investigated opportunities for, and constraints to developing a sustainable agricultural sector.Suriname is a remarkable case study. To date, Suriname has retained most of its natural resources with forest areas covering over 90% of the country. Surinamese forests combine extremely high levels of both biodiversity and carbon, making them top priority from a global ecosystem services perspective. Among other national and international pressures from increased demand for agricultural products, the country is also considering significant expansion of agricultural output to both diminish imports and become a 'bread basket' for the Caribbean region, which collectively may pose risks to natural resources.In this study, combining locally-obtained primary data, expert consultation and secondary data from the Food and Agriculture Organization we analyzed a range of scenarios, we show the complexities associated with current land management and we discuss alternatives for developing a sustainable agricultural sector in Suriname. We show that Suriname can increase the production of rice, which is the most important agricultural activity in the country, without expanding rice area. Rather, future increase in rice production could be promoted through an increase in rice productivity, and the employment of more environmentally-favorable management methods, in order to both diminish pollution and avoid encroachment of the agriculture into pristine areas. Further, we show a potential to both contribute to greening of the agricultural sector and to higher economic returns through expanding the production of 'safe food' and through possible development of organic agriculture in Suriname.If Suriname develops a 'greener' agricultural sector, it may both increase economic returns from the agricultural sector and benefit from continuing protection of natural resources. Because most of Suriname forests present top levels of carbon and biodiversity, the country could benefit from so-called 'early-action' Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) finance, which is already being paid mostly through bilateral agreements. Further, by adopting land-use planning that protects natural resources, Suriname may be in extraordinary position to benefit from both improved-quality agricultural production and from incentives to conserve forest carbon and biodiversity, such as payments for ecosystem services. Given the high stakes and the severe lack of both primary data and applied analyses in Suriname, further research focused on better informing land-use policies would be a valuable investment for the country. Although this analysis was performed for Suriname, conclusions drawn here are transferrable and may assist formulation of policy recommendations for land use elsewhere. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Avoiding deforestation; Development; Landscape approach; Organic farming; Suriname; Sustainable agriculture","agricultural development; agricultural production; alternative agriculture; bilateral agreement; biodiversity; conservation management; crop production; decision making; deforestation; land management; landscape planning; national planning; organic farming; rice; sustainable development; Suriname",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893919428

We look at forest ecosystem services, such as water regulation, carbon sequestration, and pollination provision, and evaluate the opportunities and constraints for developing systems to certify them. We discuss a series of challenges, and suggest that caution is needed: insufficient demand for multiple services, high biophysical service complexity, and elevated monitoring costs all indicate that opportunities for large-scale commercial viability of certified forest ecosystem services are limited. While some certification already exists for forest carbon services, we expect the certification of other services to remain a minor niche that seldom justifies major subsidies. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon; Co-benefits; Monitoring; Payment for environmental services; Trade off",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894754375

However, these efforts are often guided by oversimplified assumptions of how management programs work and the quantity, quality, and type of information needed to support their planning, implementation, and evaluation. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups with project managers, funders, and participants in three watershed management programs in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil revealed a range of hydrologic modeling and monitoring needs of watershed management programs. We identify five opportunities for hydrologic information to support overlapping management contexts: (1) inspire action and support, (2) inform investment decisions, (3) engage with potential participants, (4) prioritize location and types of activities at regional to national scales, and (5) evaluate program success. Within these opportunities, understanding who will use the information generated and how they will do so is critical to increasing the salience, credibility, and legitimacy of modeling efforts. Hydrologic modeling and monitoring play a small but critical role in the larger context of program conceptualization, design, implementation, and evaluation; grounding these efforts in local contexts supports watershed management projects in relevant and effective ways. ©2020.

In light of this, the present work characterizes the evolution of the ecosystem services approach as it relates to power generation from renewable sources and identifies trends that have being applied in the field worldwide. The baseline data for the analyses were retrieved from queries of an online scientific database, from which articles that contained the term “ecosystem services” and terms related to renewable energy sources were selected. Chiefly influenced by the publication of reference documents on this issue, the literature review that supported this study demonstrates some trends regarding the ecosystem services approach to renewables, most of which are related to hydropower, including the following: (i) concerns about the degree of dependence that hydropower facilities have on forest conservation; (ii) the relevance of watershed land management for reducing soil erosion to enhance energy generation by hydropower plants; (iii) the emergence of environmentally friendly operational schemes to preserve and/or alleviate the impacts of hydropower plants on river ecosystem services; (iv) the adoption of payment for ecosystem services as an instrument to foment land use strategies that benefit hydropower generation by the engagement of different stakeholders; and (v) the use of economic valuation methods as means to address trade-off scenarios between energy generation and the maintenance of certain ecosystem services. In this process, universities, governments, companies, nongovernmental organizations and even the United Nations have been engaged in different manners of discussions as a reflection of the different positions they have assumed on the subject. The results gathered indicate that there are still opportunities to improve the ecosystem services approach by extending its use to the early stages of renewable energy facilities planning, such as the environmental impact assessments of these projects. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem services; Hydropower; Renewable energy; Scientometric analysis","Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Forestry; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Land use; Query languages; Soil conservation; Ecosystem services; Hydropower; Nongovernmental organizations; Power generation from renewable; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Renewable power generation; Scientometric analysis; Ecosystems; alternative energy; analytical method; ecosystem service; environmental impact; hydroelectric power; literature review; power generation; renewable resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062957113

In Brazil, a few modeling studies assess freshwater nutrients, limiting policies on hydrologic ecosystem services. This paper aims to compare freshwater quality scenarios under different land-use and land-cover (LULC) change, one of them related to ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA), in Brazilian headwaters. Using the spatially semi-distributed Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, nitrate, total phosphorous (TP) and sediment were modeled in catchments ranging from 7.2 to 1037km2. These headwaters were eligible areas of the Brazilian payment for ecosystem services (PES) projects in the Cantareira water supply system, which had supplied water to 9 million people in the São Paulo metropolitan region (SPMR). We considered SWAT modeling of three LULC scenarios: (i) recent past scenario (S1), with historical LULC in 1990; (ii) current land-use scenario (S2), with LULC for the period 2010-2015 with field validation; and (iii) future land-use scenario with PES (S2+EbA). This latter scenario proposed forest cover restoration through EbA following the river basin plan by 2035. These three LULC scenarios were tested with a selected record of rainfall and evapotranspiration observed in 2006-2014, with the occurrence of extreme droughts. To assess hydrologic services, we proposed the hydrologic service index (HSI), as a new composite metric comparing water pollution levels (WPL) for reference catchments, related to the grey water footprint (greyWF) and water yield. On the one hand, water quality simulations allowed for the regionalization of greyWF at spatial scales under LULC scenarios. According to the critical threshold, HSI identified areas as less or more sustainable catchments. On the other hand, conservation practices simulated through the S2+EbA scenario envisaged not only additional and viable best management practices (BMP), but also preventive decision-making at the headwaters of water supply systems. © 2018 Author(s).",,"Behavioral research; Conservation; Decision making; Land use; Rain; River pollution; Runoff; Water quality; Water supply; Water supply systems; Best management practices; Conservation practices; Critical threshold; Land use and land cover; Metropolitan regions; Soil and water assessment tool; Water pollution levels; Water quality simulation; Ecosystems; adaptive management; best management practice; catchment; decision making; ecosystem service; evapotranspiration; headwater; hydrological modeling; hypothesis testing; land cover; land use change; river basin; scenario analysis; soil and water assessment tool; water footprint; water pollution; water quality; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053325458

We modeled the ecology (tree density and forest yields) and the production chain, including rents of the three major rubber products: Pressed Virgin Rubber (PVR), Liquid Latex (LL), and Liquid Smoked Sheet (LSS) from native forests and from plantations in Southern Acre, including the emblematic Chico Mendes Reserve. Our estimates show that, in native forests, tree density ranges from 0 to 4 trees/ha (average = 1.67 trees/ha), while productivity varies from 1 to 3 l/tree/year (average = 2.26 l/tree/year) with yields between 1 and 6 l/ha/year. Our model estimates a potential annual production of 890 tons of dry rubber in the 2.5 million ha of forests of Southern Acre (average = 0.36 kg/ha/year). Rubber extraction in native forests is not economically viable without government subsidies. Mean Equivalent Annual Annuity (EAA) for LL is US 3.24 ha/year in a scenario with subsidies and of 75% of potential annual harvest.

Coming from diverse disciplines such as anthropology, biology, economy, and ecology (especially human ecology), these approaches have dealt with common theory, strategies for cooperation, decision-making models, cultural contexts, and local knowledge. Fishery management depends on an understanding of the interactions between humans and aquatic resources, and in case of indigenous or of native populations, forestry resources are also considered for livelihoods. Acquiring an understanding of the local knowledge about fish and other resources, of collective local arrangements and institutions, of market interactions, and of the decision-making processes of fishers is fundamental for the management of artisanal fisheries. This review includes historical and current approaches associated with the management of artisanal fisheries. These approaches include the following: (a) cultural and human ecological approaches, including ecological models such as optimal foraging theory; (b) institutional approaches, including processes of cooperation associated with local knowledge and institutions; and (c) current ecological-economic propositions towards fishery management, such as payments for environmental services. This revision is illustrated through examples, in particular, of data collected among coastal artisanal fisheries of the SE Atlantic Forest in Brazil. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cooperation; Cultural ecology; Fisheries; Kinship; Management","artisanal fishery; coastal zone; cultural geography; data acquisition; decision making; ecological modeling; fish; fishery management; kinship; Atlantic Forest; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891633373

In this study, changes in land cover in Sierra de Juarez–Oaxaca ecosystems were estimated using a consistent processing of Landsat images and OBIA methodology. Additionally, landscape analyses using FRAGSTAT were conducted. In 2014, Sierra de Juarez–Oaxaca was covered by approximately 84% of forests, mainly pine-oak and cloud forests. After extensive deforestation until 2001, this trend was reversed and the forest cover surface area in 2014 was slightly higher than in 1979. The comparison of the landscape structure of the forested and agricultural lands suggests an increase in habitat heterogeneity. However, interspersion and juxtaposition indices, showing the patch shape by patch area and perimeter, were similar throughout the study period (1979–2014). Social and economic drivers can explain this situation: namely, community organization, forest enterprises, payment for ecosystem services programs, and changes of agricultural activity. Communities in the Sierra of Oaxaca have reforested degraded lands, created community forest enterprises, and preserved the forest under conservation schemes like those proposed by the Mexican payment for ecosystem services programs. However, their sustainable management faces internal challenges and has become highly dependent on political and institutional decisions beyond their control. © 2018, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","FRAGSTAT; Land uses segmentation; OBIA; Social forestry; Tropical and temperate forests","agricultural land; conservation status; deciduous forest; ecosystem service; forest cover; forest ecosystem; forest management; habitat fragmentation; image processing; land cover; land use change; Landsat; landscape structure; montane forest; Neotropical Region; satellite imagery; segmentation; sustainable forestry; temperate forest; tropical forest; Mexico [North America]; Oaxaca; Sierra de Juarez",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042098068

The municipality of Extrema in Minas Gerais state in Brazil pioneered the first Brazilian municipal PES initiative (Conservador das Águas program), based on the relationship between forests and the benefits they provide. This study aimed to assess soil loss in the Posses sub-basin, where the Conservador das Águas program began. Additionally, we aimed to determine the potential that this PES initiative has for soil conservation, as well as to minimize the soil losses as a function of forest area size and location in order to propose a technical approach for implementing PES. In this sense, considering the prescribed conservation practices, land use situation, and soil cover in the Posses sub-basin, we analyzed the effectiveness of the Conservador das Águas program before and after implementation in relation to reduced soil loss under 36 different land use and soil cover scenarios. We used a geographic information system (GIS) for spatializing and producing different information plans and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) for estimating soil loss. As a result, we found that minimization of soil loss may be obtained by adopting pasture conservation practices. Additionally the expected average soil loss in the Posses sub-basin under conditions of land use and soil cover, before and after implementing the water conservation program was 30.63 and 7.06Mgha-1year-1, respectively. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Land cover; Soil conservation; Sustainability; Water conservation program","Forestry; Geographic information systems; Land use; Sediment transport; Soils; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water resources; Conservation practices; Conservation programs; Land cover; Minas Gerais; Payments for environmental services; Reduced soils; Revised universal soil loss equations; Water use conflicts; Soil conservation; basin management; forest cover; GIS; land use; soil conservation; soil cover; Conservation; Forestry; GIS; Land Use; Soil; Water Management; Water Resources; Brazil; Minas Gerais",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896052942

In participatory field trials with communities in Western Kenya, we combined procurement auctions for forest enrichment contracts with performance-based payments and compared the outcomes with a baseline scenario currently used by the Kenyan Forest Service. Procurement auctions were the most cost-effective. The competitive nature of the auction reduced contracting expenses (provision costs), and the result-oriented payments provided additional incentives to care for the planted seedlings, resulting in their improved survival rates (service quantity). These gains clearly exceeded increases in transaction costs associated with conducting an auction. The number of income-poor auction participants and winners was disproportionately high and local institutional buy-in was remarkably strong. Our participatory approach may, however, require adaptations when conducted at a larger scale. Although the number of contracts we monitored was limited and prohibited the use of statistical tests, our study is one of the first to reveal the benefits of using auctions for PES in developing countries. © 2014 Society for Conservation Biology.","Contracting; Cost-effectiveness; Kakamega; PES; Procurement; Tender","cost-benefit analysis; environmental economics; forest management; forestry policy; statistical analysis; survivorship; transaction cost; Kenya; comparative study; cost benefit analysis; economics; environmental protection; forestry; Kenya; procedures; Conservation of Natural Resources; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Forestry; Kenya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900395921

Deforestation cost studies have ignored the likelihood and possible economic impact of a forest-savanna critical transition, therefore underestimating the true social cost of deforestation. We explore the implications of a forest-savanna critical transition and propose an alternative framework for calculating the economic value of a standing tropical forest. Our framework is based on an average cost method, as opposed to currently used marginal cost methods, for the design of optimal land-use policy or payments for ecosystem services.

In this study we estimated the carbon prices needed to promote mangrove conservation and restoration under mechanisms of payment for ecosystem services (PES). We mapped the remaining and deforested mangroves across the globe in 2017, and crossed this information with carbon stocks in the biomass and soil and with land opportunity and restoration costs. In accordance with previous studies we found that Southeast Asia holds the largest opportunities for blue carbon programs to support conservation and restoration. Conserving remaining mangroves would avoid the release of up to 15.51 PgCO2 to the atmosphere, and could be achieved at carbon prices between 3.0 and 13.0 US$ per tCO2 for 90% of remaining mangroves. Restoring mangroves can sequester up to 0.32 PgCO2 globally. Carbon prices between 4.5 and 18.0 US$ per tCO2 could support the restoration of 90% of deforested mangroves. Such prices, however, may not apply to contexts of high-profit alternative land-uses. In such contexts, the valuation of co-benefits and the combination of carbon-based mechanisms and sustainable management may be a viable pathway. © 2020","Break-even price; Deforestation; Global mangrove map; Land opportunity cost; Map of worlds; Payment for ecosystem services; REDD+","carbon sequestration; climate change; conservation status; cost-benefit analysis; ecological economics; global perspective; mangrove; restoration ecology; Southeast Asia; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086945666

Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been proposed as a way to protect some of these ES, but decisions regarding what gets protection and what gets consumed can be a source of conflicts. One such example is the Fernando de Noronha MPA (Brazil), where there is a conflict between shark-directed tourism and fishers who would like to access the no-take part of the MPA during part of the year. A contingent valuation method (Willingness to Pay) was used to ascertain if tourists would accept compensating fishers for not disturbing the sharks during a specific period of the year, by adding a symbolic increase in the taxes they already pay to either visit the island or to visit the no-take part of the MPA. Tourists were open to this alternative (67–71%), regardless of the fee being paid. However, there was a slight tendency to reject the fee when the tourists saw sharks during their stay, suggesting that a closer contact with these animals triggered a less sympathetic attitude towards fishers, probably because they start seeing fishers as wrongdoers, even if this is the worst choice for conservation. Although such a hypothetical payment was easily accepted by the majority of the tourists and could represent an affordable solution to conflicts, convincing those who reject such social compensation, especially if based on an irrational choice, would be an important step for sharks and for the MPA as a whole. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Fernando de Noronha; Payment for Ecosystem Services; Shark conservation; Shark tourism; Willingness to Pay","contingent valuation; ecosystem service; fishery management; nature conservation; protected area; shark; willingness to pay; Fernando de Noronha; Pernambuco; Animalia; Chondrichthyes; Pristiophoridae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044587305

Studies are needed to improve the understanding of the effect of the extent and position along the watershed of restored areas on soil and water conservation. This study aimed to understand how different restoration strategies might reflect in soil conservation and sediment retention. Using InVEST tool, sediment transport was simulated in a small 12 km2 watershed (Posses River, in Southeast Brazil), where one of first Brazilian Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) projects is being carried out, comparing different hypothetical restoration strategies. With 25% of restoration, sediment export decreased by 78% for riparian restoration, and 27% for the steepest slopes restoration. On the other hand, the decrease in soil loss was lower for riparian restoration, with a 16% decrease, while the steepest slopes restoration reduced it by 21%. This mismatch between the reduction of sediment export and soil loss was explained by the fact that forest not only reduces soil loss locally but also traps sediment arriving from the upper parts of the watershed. While the first mechanism is important to provide soil stability, decreasing the risk of landslip, and to maintain agricultural productivity, the second can improve water quality and decrease the risk of silting, with positive effects on the water reservoirs at the outlet of the watershed. This suggests that Riparian and the Steepest Slopes restoration strategies are complementary in the sense of preventing sediments from reaching the water bodies as well as protecting them at their origin (with the reduction of erosion), so it will be advisable to consider the two types of restoration. © 2018 Saad et al.

This systematic comparison is performed by analyzing four major characteristics of PES: identity of traded ecosystem service (ES); spatial scale; type of transaction involved between ES providers and beneficiaries; and the involved actors. Information on the biophysical characteristics, institutional arrangement and financial options of PES-RC were assessed using participatory methods. We found that on the one hand there is an agreement between our case study and the prevailing successful cases of PES-LA regarding the traded ES (water) and the PES spatial scale (local). However, stakeholder opinions diverge from the success cases when it comes to the type of transaction (cash preferred in PES-RC; in-kind in successful PES-LA) and the involved actors. Our results raise the question whether stakeholder opinions or the characteristics of successful (or failure) cases should be prioritized when planning and operationalizing new PES schemes. We argue that stakeholder participation should be considered as an additional success criterion for the construction of public policies directed towards PES implementation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Atlantic Forest; Brazilian Forest Code; Nature conservation; Participatory methods; Public policies; Rio Claro - SP municipality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993969490

In this context, the concept of Payment for Environmental Services (PES) has been widely accepted and applied around the world and also in Brazil. The municipality of Extrema, in the State of Minas Gerais, was the first in Brazil to implement a PES program, known as ""Conservador das Águas"". This study aimed to evaluate soil losses in the watershed Posses and determine the potential of the PES program to conserve soil in this watershed; moreover, to maximize the soil conservation environmental service for a given forest size and location. Therefore, the effectiveness of soil conservation was analyzed in 14 areas with different soil use and forest cover. The Geographic Information System (SIG) and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) were used for this purpose. Soil losses in the Posses watershed were estimated before and after implementing the water conservation program, at 30.63 and 7.06 Mg ha-1 year-1, respectively. Conservation could be optimized by implementing soil conservation practices on pasture and by optimizing the location of forest areas.","Sediment production; Soil conservation; Sustainability; Water; Water conservation program; Watershed",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856851387

This commitment is legally backed by the Native Vegetation Protection Law (NVPL), which defines the situations in which landowners must recover native vegetation in their land. In this paper, we discuss the role of land use compliance as a driver for adaptation in the Brazilian Atlantic forest domain based on the case of the State of Rio de Janeiro. We used high resolution satellite imagery (5 m pixel) to map the state's land use and land cover, delineate Areas of Permanent Preservation and calculate the environmental debt, i.e. the areas required for restoration in order to comply to the NVPL. We also related the distribution of the environmental debt to the socioeconomic conditions of the municipalities and examined potential funding sources for economic incentives to enhance feasibility of restoration in private lands. The state has 31% of native vegetation cover, and an environmental debt of 412,876 ha, correlated to Human Development Index (R = −0.2952, p = 0.0043) and vulnerability to poverty (R = 0.3711, p = 0.0003). The north-northwestern region hosts the hotspots both for environmental debt and vulnerability to poverty, therefore it should constitute a priority target for environmental and social policies. Compliance to this large environmental debt to abide to the regulatory policy NVPL will demand incentive mechanisms. Oil royalties are a potential funding source for programs of payment for ecosystem services, as 3% of those annual revenues could pay the restoration of 39% of the state's environmental debt per year over 20 years. Thus, policy mixes that combine existing regulatory and incentive mechanisms should ensure low-cost landscape restoration in tandem with new job opportunities in a restoration chain, and might represent a significant opportunity for the State of Rio de Janeiro. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem-based adaptation; Environmental policy; Large scale restoration; Nationally determined contributions; State of Rio de Janeiro","adaptive management; climate change; compliance; ecosystem service; environmental planning; environmental policy; environmental restoration; forest management; land use; regulatory approach; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Rio de Janeiro [Brazil]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041622002

This biome covers an area of about 2 million km2, i.e. nearly 24% of the total area of Brazil, and has come under substantial pressure during the last 50 years caused by strong land-use/land-cover change, mostly due to agricultural expansion and urbanization. Because of its fast transformation rate, there is an enormous demand for knowledge, and its application, about the effects of land-use/land-cover on the capacity of providing or maintaining ecosystem services. The MapES approach was developed using a vast existing knowledge base. After analyzing and structuring this knowledge the relationships between land-use/land-cover and the potential to provide or maintain eight ecosystem services (Erosion Control, Runoff Control, Water Supply, Water Quality Maintenance, Soil Quality Maintenance, Biodiversity Maintenance, Food Production and Energy Production) were parametrized. In addition, the approach was developed as spatially explicit by including landscape properties (soil, slope and distance to river network) in the cell based system. A reference map of potential natural vegetation and a land use map for 2013 for a meso-scale experimental catchment (32.7 km2) were produced. The catchment was used as an example to apply the approach, i.e. assessing and visualizing changes from before human interference to the current land use situation. Finally, a procedure for assessing the potential impacts of land-use/land-cover on ecosystem services considering the methodological limitations of the respective monitoring. The presented approach is easy to understand, to modify and to adapt to other situations and might be therefore used in other context of decision support. It might also help to fill the gap between land use planning and numeric modeling using very complex tools. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Integrated water resource management; Knowledge-based approach; Land management; Payment for ecosystem services","Biodiversity; Complex networks; Ecology; Knowledge based systems; Land use; Maintenance; Mapping; Quality control; Runoff; Soil conservation; Water management; Water quality; Water resources; Water supply; Agricultural expansion; Ecosystem services; Experimental catchments; Integrated water resource management; Knowledge-based approach; Land managements; Land use/land cover change; Quality maintenances; Ecosystems; agricultural extension; cerrado; ecosystem service; experimental study; knowledge; land cover; land management; land use change; land use planning; spatial analysis; urbanization; vegetation mapping; water management; water resource; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025657168

In Brazil, the Forest Code permits PES but does not specify the scheme operationalization. The way ESS should be quantified and valued has not yet been implemented country-wide, nor has the funding source for PES. Through interviews with farmers in Rio Claro-SP, Brazil, and in Cairngorms National Park in the highlands and lowlands of Scotland, UK, we compared farmers’ perspectives concerning ESS and PES, focusing on the PES implementation in sugarcane landscape in São Paulo state. While Scottish farmers perceived more cultural services, Brazilian farmers focused on regulating services, which we attribute to socio-political and landscape differences. Despite these differences, farmers in both areas preferred opportunity cost approach for ESS valuation because this method captures efforts to maintain ESS. Thereby, the opportunity cost should be considered for valuation in PES schemes, but conversely, budgetary constraints make it impossible to satisfy farmers with PES in regions of high productivity in the southeast of Brazil. Lessons learned concerning the PES subsidies in Scotland indicates the importance of co-designing schemes with stakeholders, minimizing trade-offs between the environment. Therefore, the participants as ESS providers, beneficiaries and intermediaries in the public policies arena was recognized for co-optimize the trade-offs between costs and effectiveness in PES. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cairngorms National Park; Participatory methods; Payment for ecosystem services; Public policies; Sugarcane production",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058626699

Therefore, bundling them can be an effective way to maximize the return to the investments in programs of payments for ecosystem services (PES). Here, we investigated the additional gain of restoration actions—which were implemented as part of a PES program to protect a key watershed for water supply—on increasing functional landscape connectivity in the Atlantic Forest region of southeastern Brazil. Using a landscape ecology approach, we estimated the amount of forest cover before (2006) and after (2012) restoration activities by the PES program and changes in structural and functional landscape connectivity for birds with varying gap-crossing capabilities. Forest cover increased from 42.5 to 86.1 ha after the implementation of restoration projects by the PES program. In the simulated scenarios of landscape connectivity, the mean patch size of functionally connected forest increased by 1,034%, 392%, 248%, and 94% for species with gap-crossing capabilities of 0, 20, 40, and 60 m, respectively.

In southern Pará, Brazilian Amazon, farmers manage native shade trees growing with cacao, but species selection may be not appropriate to AFS maintenance over time. The objective of this study was to understand the shade trees transition between successional management phases of cacao-AFS, considering its initial shade (IS) and secondary shade (SS). It was sampled 10 plots in each situation (20,000 m2 in total) identifying individuals with CBH ≥ 15 cm. As expected, floristic composition was different and SS had greater species richness and diversity than IS, where only 17% of species were the shared among them. Musa sp. and Carica papaya L. were found only in IS and were dominant species, representing almost a half of the individuals. Although there was increase of late succession species from IS to SS, this still keeps high abundance of early succession species, such as Cecropia sp. The result shows an unexploited potential products and gap of services provision, such as N-fixing. The conclusion highlights the necessity of long-term succession planning and management practices to guarantee cacao crop maintenance and improve diversification with other income sources, such as fruits and wood. The role of biodiversity conservation, provided by shade trees, should be the target of political strategies to encourage its maintenance, such as payment for ecosystems services or other economic incentives. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Agroforestry; Cacao; Cocoa; Diversity; Eastern Amazon; Shade tree","agricultural land; agricultural management; agroforestry; cocoa; community composition; shade tolerance; smallholder; succession; Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil; Para [Brazil]; Carica papaya; Cecropia; Musa sp.; Theobroma cacao",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047114653

We used the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land (LPJmL) model, to address following questions for Mexico, Bolivia and Brazilian Amazon: (i) How different are C stocks and C sequestration quantifications under standard (when soil and litter C and heterotrophic respiration are not considered) and comprehensive (including all C stock and heterotrophic respiration) approach? and (ii) How does the valuation of C stock and C sequestration differ in national payments for ES and global C funds or markets when comparing both approach? We found that up to 65% of C stocks have not been taken into account by neglecting to include C stored in soil and litter, resulting in gross underpayments (up to 500 times lower). Since emissions from heterotrophic respiration of organic material offset a large proportion of C gained through growth of living matter, we found that markets and decision-makers are inadvertently overestimating up to 100 times C sequestrated. New approaches for modelling C services relevant ecological process-based can help accounting for C in soil, litter and heterotrophic respiration and become important for the operationalization of agreements on climate change mitigation following the COP21 in 2015. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Increased agricultural production could reduce fallow period length with implications for manioc flour (farinha) production. We hypothesize that payments for environmental services (PES) programs may exacerbate reduction of fallow periods, thereby reducing per stem farinha productivity. To understand the household scale economic impacts of avoided deforestation under PES programs, we conducted interviews in 158 households from 32 communities in the Brazilian state of Amazonas. Using regression models, we assessed which variables most influenced farinha production, and calculated production costs and total revenues, with and without a PES program. Manioc yield increased by 22.83 kg per household per year for each additional year that the forest was left to recover before being cleared. Although production costs were higher for land cleared from older secondary forests, net profits on land cleared from primary forests were still higher. Total income from PES programs, when added to the secondary forest manioc profit, were higher than the foregone production in primary forest areas. However, when we considered only direct cash payments, we identified potential trade-offs. We conclude that PES programmes should consider possible long-term effects of payments on the livelihoods of participants. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Bolsa Floresta; Bolsa Verde; Deforestation; Manioc; PES","agricultural production; cost analysis; crop yield; deforestation; economic impact; ecosystem service; environmental economics; forest ecosystem; livelihood; rural population; secondary forest; Amazonas [Brazil]; Amazonia; Brazil; Manihot esculenta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049349896

The implementation of this policy created several challenges, such as establishing effective management within the framework of rural territorial structure. The example of the Cantareira's System in Piracicaba river watershed is conducive to the understanding of this challenge. In this scenario, we analyzed the effective implementation of principles, and of two instruments of water resource management from the perspective of farmers' participation: the integration of water management and rural land use, and public policies for rural areas. To accomplish this, we reviewed documents and literature, and considered conclusions drawn from meetings at the Technical Chamber of Use and Water Conservation in Rural Areas (CT-Rural). We identified a lack of participation by farmers' representatives in the CT-Rural Chamber and little concern to increase their participation in the management practices. However, the support payments for environmental services projects (PES) are stimulating farmers and calling attention to the Cantareira area, in addition to promoting the integration of water resource management and rural land use. However, even though this support acknowledges the importance of the farmers, we emphasize the low priority given by the Piracicaba, Capivari and Jundiaí Watershed Committee to the rural context of the area studied.","Cantareira system; Rural development; Water resources",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891060916

Here, we propose using a social-ecological network approach to develop a ‘landscape governance framework’ that identifies how different types of governance can act on supply, demand and flow of ecosystem services through changes in landscape structure and connections. Starting from undesirable situations where demand exceeds supply, we exemplify the application of this conceptual model considering hierarchical (e.g. creation of protected areas), market (e.g. payments for environmental services) and community-based (e.g. enhancing links between stakeholders) governance approaches. We show how interventions associated with each of these approaches act in distinct ways to regulate different components of the service provision chain in heterogeneous landscapes. Filling such knowledge gaps can help identify appropriate governance interventions depending on factors that limit provision: restricted supply, demand or flow. The application of the landscape governance framework entails challenges related to availability of data and limited understanding of key underlying mechanisms. However, it opens important new research questions at the interface between governance and ecosystem services, with great potential as a tool for landscape management that aims to achieve ecosystem service sustainability.

In this article, we discuss the lessons learned from the Water Producer Project, a pioneer, multiple-stakeholder, and PES-supported FLR project in the Atlantic Forest, south-eastern Brazil. The project was implemented in four landscapes located in two municipalities. Altogether, 41 PES contracts with landowners were signed, resulting in various FLR practices being implemented in a total of 342.4 ha (64.2 ha for riparian forest restoration, 90.8 ha for soil conservation, and 187.4 for forest conservation) of land, which represents 39% of the project goal. As of the end of the project, only 50% (USD 49,250) of the available PES funds had been spent. However, funds spent on project planning, implementation, communication, and monitoring were 12 times greater than those spent on PES. Several challenges restricted the progress and monitoring of the project. The main issue was landowner participation and/or engagement. In terms of lessons learned, we highlight that PES schemes are more complex than initially thought, and that sufficient funding does not guarantee the success of FLR projects. It is essential to promote landowner participation and engagement by considering them key players in FLR projects. Finally, acceptance from landowners was higher and implementation was easier for forest conservation practices that required no land-use changes. Thus, we suggest that similar future projects should focus on targeting private properties in marginal agricultural lands with a high probability of natural regeneration. Alternatively, future projects could focus on lands with remnant forest cover of high conservation value. © 2019 by the authors.","Ecological restoration; Forest and landscape restoration; Forest restoration; Landowner engagement; Payment for ecosystem services; Tropical forest; Water","Ecosystems; Land reclamation; Land use; Restoration; Soil conservation; Water; Ecological restoration; Ecosystem services; Forest restoration; Landowner engagement; Landscape restoration; Tropical forest; Reforestation; ecosystem service; forest ecosystem; land use change; landowner; participatory approach; restoration ecology; Ecosystems; Land Reclamation; Land Use; Reforestation; Restoration; Water; Atlantic Forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075349313

As effectiveness is influenced by PWS design and the local contexts in which they are implemented, deficiencies in the process of targeting providers can affect the success of PWS schemes in achieving their goals. This article presents a framework based on data obtained from systematic reviews of worldwide Payments for Environmental Services (PES) schemes and the scientific literature to guide the process of targeting PWS schemes, especially in rural private areas in fragmented landscapes. The framework comprises four sets of operational guidelines for the targeting process based on the scientific literature. A table explaining the data extracted from the literature and PES schemes is provided, comprising the targeting criteria of benefits, risk, cost, socioeconomic issues, and readiness. The framework supplements current approaches that focus on biophysical criteria and is the first initiative to incorporate multidimensional aspects of PES in targeting guidelines. As it gathers empirical and scientific knowledge to promote an effective scheme design, the framework can contribute to the achievement of PWS goals. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Payments for environmental services; Prioritization; Priority areas; Targeting; Watershed schemes; Watershed services","Economics; Forestry; Environmental services; Fragmented landscapes; Operational guidelines; Payments for environmental services; Prioritization; Priority areas; Scientific literature; Targeting; Watersheds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064641883

This article analyses the key characteristics of REDD + pilot initiatives in Brazil from different perspectives concerning the concept of payment for environmental services, while exploring how these characteristics relate to the funding models adopted, regardless of whether they are sourced from public funds or via the carbon market. Data collected from publicly available databases are analysed using hypothesis tests. Ten variables from 89 pilot initiatives approved by the Voluntary Carbon Market or the Fundo Amazônia (Amazon Fund) are examined. Findings show that initiatives under each funding model have distinct characteristics in terms of stakeholders, criteria for incentive concession, time frames, geographical reach, as well as Measurement, Report and Verification (MRV) practices. Differences are consistent with distinct theoretical conceptions on incentive-based economic instruments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Payments for environmental services; REDD + finance","climate change; deforestation; ecosystem service; emission control; emissions trading; environmental degradation; financial services; global climate; incentive; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; willingness to pay; Brazil; Nia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018454003

Hydroelectric plants are among the most vulnerable enterprises to climate change. Investing in the conservation of the hydrographic basin is a solution found by the hydropower sector. Given the importance of the Itaipu plant to the energy matrix of Brazil and Paraguay, the aim of this study is to review the current distribution of royalties from Itaipu, using the hydrographic basin as a of criterion of analysis. Approximately 98.73% of the Itaipu basin is in Brazil. The flow contributes 99% of the total electricity generated there, while the drop height of the water contributes only 1%. Under the current policy, royalties are shared equally between Brazil and Paraguay. In the proposed approach, each country would receive a percentage for their participation in the drop height and water flow in the output of the turbines, which are intrinsic factors for electricity generation. Thus, Brazil would receive 98.35% of the royalties and Paraguay, 1.65%. The inclusion of the hydrographic basin as a criterion for the distribution of royalties will promote more efficient water resource management, since the payment will be distributed throughout the basin of the plant. The methodology can be applied to hydroelectric projects worldwide. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Catchment management; Hydroelectricity; Payment for environmental services; Water resources","basin management; climate change; ecosystem service; electricity generation; environmental policy; hydroelectric power; local participation; resource management; risk assessment; turbine; water flow; water resource; water storage; Article; Brazil; electricity; environmental policy; evapotranspiration; fluid balance; hydrography; hydropower; Paraguay; river basin; runoff; spatial analysis; water flow; water management; water supply; climate change; economics; electric power plant; environmental protection; human; procedures; river; Brazil; Itapua; Paraguay; Brazil; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Humans; Paraguay; Power Plants; Rivers; Water Resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006742009

The Ribeirão das Posses watershed is being monitored as a headwater of the Jaguarí River, which is one of the contributing rivers of the Cantareira Reservoir Complex in the state of São Paulo. The landscape has changed over the last century from native forests to more homogeneous vegetation for pastures, crops and some forest plantations of eucalyptus, which have cumulative impacts on water yield and quality. Currently, the Projeto Conservador das Águas (Water Conservationist Project) has planted small areas with native species vegetation in order to recover degraded areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate the quantity of water in the Ribeirão das Posses Basin by both measurements and by simulating hydrological responses. The Agricultural Ecosystem Services (AgES) watershed model was applied to simulate water movement and storage among land areas. The simulation period was from 2009 to 2014, because the daily streamflow and meteorological data were available for model calibration and testing. We discuss data input requirements, model calibration to fit measured streamflow, and sensitivity to spatially variable rainfall inputs. The calibrated model may be used to estimate streamflow during periods of missing data, and in the future to estimate impacts of land use changes on stream water quantity and quality.

The municipality of Ibiúna in São Paulo/SP is adequate for PES because it is located in a strategic position for public water supply and has agricultural production and an Environmental Protection Area - APA, Itupararanga. In this context, the watershed of the Murundu Stream, located entirely in the municipality of Ibiúna / SP, was selected for this work. This study involved the interactions between landscape structure, relief and hydrography in this watershed by the classification and cross tabulation of the slope and land use and land cover layers, as input for the generation of a thematic map of priority areas for conservation and preservation of water. The analyses indicate that most of the watershed is dominated by medium/advanced forests (30.1% of the watershed extent) concentrated at the upper parts of the basin and increasing in area as the slope gets steeper. Although a large portion of the watershed is preserved, various uses were observed in areas of permanent preservation.

However, this program has no pre-established restrictions of eligibility of application areas or conservation proposals. With a view to contribute to the methodological development of this program, a new approach was proposed, by analysis of two main changes: introduction of eligibility criteria, and the use of land suitability for recommendation of proposals for intensive soil use and conservation. For this purpose, a rural catchment was studied near the Brazilian Pantanal, in Terenos, MS. The new eligibility criteria were based on the natural erosion risk (ratio of natural erosion potential and soil loss tolerance). The land use proposals, in turn, were based on a pre-defined land suitability map. This study reveals that the new eligibility criteria covered only about 40 % of the study area. The classification of land suitability in this area reduced the intensive land use alternatives dramatically, indicating it largely for cattle ranching.

Higienópolis, 901, São Paulo, SP, Brazil","Over the last few decades, numerous initiatives have advanced forest landscape restoration in the Amazon, and in 2015 the Brazilian government set an ambitious, still-valid, target to restore 4.8 million hectares of degraded Amazonian land by 2030. This has contributed to an emergent global restoration network that connects multiple stakeholders and processes for funding, implementing and monitoring restoration actions in such a way that prepares various ecosystem services for market integration. The network arose in tandem with the evolution of an institutional framework that includes regulatory requirements within Brazil, global commitments linked to climate change mitigation, corporate sustainability strategies, and the growth of crowd-sourcing activism. This paper presents restoration activities as embedded within a Global Production Network (GPN) for an ecosystem service, which we use as a heuristic device to inform our understanding of emergent environmental governance structures. The resulting multi-scalar, networked mode of environmental governance is presented as a web-like structure co-created by institutional evolution, actor-specific strategies, and interactions between firms and non-firm actors. The article pays particular attention to a case study of how the restoration network manifests territorially in the Upper Xingu region of the Brazilian Amazon. Despite the strong North-South orientation of dominant funding relationships, network governance is also seen to be relational. This is evident from the dissemination of ideas, supply models and seeding techniques from Upper Xingu to other regions of Brazil. These insights could be applied to improve landscape restoration outcomes, and indeed the provisioning of ecosystem services more broadly. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Amazon; Climate change; Ecological restoration; Environmental governance; Global production networks; Payments for ecosystem services","climate change; ecosystem service; governance approach; institutional framework; orientation; restoration ecology; sustainability; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081549690

The idea developed throughout the text is the result of a water shortage experience in a Brazilian medium-size city, related to recurrent climatological events, indicating the need for national and international water management agencies to elaborate policies, guidelines and mechanisms that take environmental seasonality into account. The study area (Itabuna city) is located within a rainforest biogeographic context, with high rainfall rates and perennial fluvial regimes. Nevertheless, in a period of climatic oscillation (2015-2016), the region experienced a water shortage because it relied on what it neglects. Through GIS and geoprocessing, we estimate the levels of degradation of two neighboring watersheds to illustrate the problem discussed here. The discourse adopted by the urban managers pointed out that the natural factors caused the water crisis. However, one of the watersheds that supply water to urban areas did not meet demand during the dry season, the other is degraded and with reduced ability to deliver ecosystem services. Due to the water crisis, an old proposal of implementing a dam in the watershed with highest level of degradation was resumed and implanted. The method chosen to solve the issue of water shortage, although valid, isn't enough, in addition to demanding large engineering interventions in the natural environment, it does not guarantee water security without an effective land use policy for watersheds. Therefore, as a complement to the dam, we suggest watershed restoration and preservation policies that can effectively regulate water production and promote resilient and sustainable water security should be implemented. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","ENSO; Humid tropical climate; Northeastern Brazil; Payments for environmental services; Water management; Water security","crisis management; ecosystem service; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; humid tropics; sustainability; water management; water planning; water resource; water supply; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059238783

In order to summarize current knowledge regarding ES, the structure for teaching in ES, and also to provide a basis for future research in Brazil, we carried out a systematic review of publications on ES and a study on the availability of undergraduate and graduate courses related to ES. We found 282 publications for the 2006-2017 period, which included peer-reviewed articles, books, book chapters, theses, dissertations, articles in annals and technical publications. We identified current knowledge, knowledge gaps and trends in ES researches that may guide surveys and scenario analyses for future studies, in different biomes and regions of the country. Atlantic Forest and Amazon are the most-studied biome. Most of the studies were related to the evaluation of different types of ES and to the development of methodologies for their evaluation and monitoring. The most common ES are related to biodiversity, carbon sequestration and water. © 2019, Institute for Environmental Research in Hydrographic Basins (IPABHi).

The PES is linked to the “Water Guardian” project, which aims to ensure the preservation of water resources by paying farmers for providing the environmental services to protect the springs and riparian areas that lie within their properties. Twenty sampling stations were selected for collecting water samples monthly during the period July 2012 to June 2014 (460 samples) to evaluate the following variables: water temperature, pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, nitrate, ammonia nitrogen, phosphate, total dissolved solids and thermotolerant coliforms. The evaluation was made based on decree 357/2005 of the National Environmental Council (CONAMA) and by applying the Water Quality Index (WQI). The results indicated a significant improvement in the water quality when comparisons were made between the periods before and after the installation of the preservation areas. The sampling points classified as “good” (CONAMA and WQI), which indicates water of good quality that is appropriate for multiple uses, increased from 52.0% to 72.0%. In this sense, promoting the preservation of headwaters and riparian zones becomes of fundamental importance and highlights the role of PES as an operational tool for water resource preservation.","Hydrographical basin of andreas stream; Payment for environmental services (pes); Water quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063500288

Based on the analytical framework of Property Rights proposed in the studies of Elinor Ostrom, Guido Calabresi and Douglas Melamed, three economic instruments of environmental management (taxation, negotiable certificate systems and payments for environmental services) were analyzed, as well as the Brazilian experience of each of them.We observed that, in trying to set a more efficient and sustainable economic system through internalization of environmental externalities, economic instruments for environmental management engender a variety of tacit property rights' attributions related to the envi-ronment.That is, to achieve efficient results (both environmentally and economically), it is essential that the Law acts in the sense of guaranteeing the legal security of these attributions, formalizing clear institutional arrangements and imposing effective sanctions for those who are not compliant with the legal and economic schemes established for the instruments. It is clear, therefore, that an effective environmental policy cannot dispense a multidisciplinary approach that combines economic and legal sciences.","Economic instruments for environmental management; Externalities; Property rights",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030755805

A more extended review of general RDA techniques confirmed the potential for associating other ES to RDA techniques used in mining, an example here is the enhancement of carbon stocks. Support for actions could come from existing PES schemes, particularly for cases where the ES identified as associated with an RDA technique are related to soil and water conservation. Concluding remarks indicate that there is a potential scenario for ES diversification in the reclamation stage of mining operations. A first step towards accomplishing this diversification envisages the creation of a PES scheme specific to the mining sector. Further studies are needed to develop criteria for fostering a PES scheme specifically for the reclamation phase of mining operations in Brazil.","Environmental services; Mining; Payment for environmental services; Reclamation of degraded areas",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982952414

Some authors suggest that REDD+ can bring additional benefits for biodiversity, namely for the conservation of extinction-prone restricted-range species. Here, we assess this claim, using São Tomé Island (Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe) as a case study. We quantified the abundance of bird and tree species, and calculated the aboveground carbon stocks across a gradient of land-use intensity. We found a strong spatial congruence between carbon and the presence and abundance of endemic species, supporting the potential of REDD+ to protect these taxa. We then assessed if REDD+ could help protect the forests of São Tomé and Príncipe. To do so, we used OSIRIS simulations to predict country-level deforestation under two different REDD+ designs. These simulations showed that REDD+ could promote the loss of forests in São Tomé and Príncipe through leakage. This happened even when additional payments for biodiversity were included in the simulations, and despite São Tomé and Príncipe having the fourth highest carbon stocks per land area and the second highest biodiversity values according to the OSIRIS database. These results show weaknesses of OSIRIS as a planning tool, and demonstrate that the benefits that REDD+ might bring for biodiversity are strongly dependent on its careful implementation. We recommend that payment for ecosystem services programmes such as REDD+ develop safeguards to ensure that biodiversity co-benefits are met and perverse outcomes are avoided across all tropical countries. In particular, we advise specific safeguards regarding the conservation of extinction-prone groups, such as island restricted-range species. © 2013 de Lima et al.",,"carbon; article; bird; carbon footprint; carbon source; case study; community program; conservation biology; deforestation; environmental management; environmental protection; fee; forest management; island (geological); land use; nonhuman; population abundance; prediction; Sao Tome and Principe; simulation; species conservation; species endemicity; species extinction; Animals; Biodiversity; Birds; Carbon; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884191608

The findings have demonstrated that good agricultural practices and the presence of natural secondary vegetation favored by the management of small family farms are important factors for hydrobiogeochemical cycling, aquatic ecosystem conservation, soil conservation, and mitigation of trace gases emissions from biomass burning in Amazonian small catchments. Two challenges for watershed service management arise in this context. First, low population densities and the relatively flat landscape mean that a critical mass of downstream beneficiaries of such services - a prerequisite for public intervention is more difficult to identify than in more densely populated mountainous areas. Second, although watershed service providers (farmers) are also to a considerable extent service beneficiaries, conflicts over land and cultural heterogeneities among settlers inhibit local collective action to safeguard the quality of stream water. Including small landholders in carbon payment schemes that compensate for the maintenance of riverbank vegetation would appear to be a cost-effective means to secure watershed services as additional benefits of forest-based mitigation of climate change.","Good agricultural practices; Hydrobiogeochemistry; Payments for ecosystem services; Stream water quality; Watershed management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883407444

Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) result in many alterations of the basin water balance. Therefore, to contribute to the methodological development of Brazilian PES, this paper proposes a quantification of hydrological benefits based on conservation measures. We propose basing the PES program on adding the potential water storage increase (WSI) parameter estimated from the runoff curve number model. Two LULC change scenarios were run considering conservation measures on degraded areas. We found that indicators of ED and WSI were compatible tools for driving the eligibility of soil and water conservation measures. However, the water storage parameter seems to be better at managing the PES mechanism because it is based on water prices and can contribute to appreciation of the efforts performed by the rural producers. The use of the SCS-CN method presents greater feasibility as a tool for the implementation of PES programs in ungauged basins. Thus, an analysis of the success of the innovation proposal of the Brazilian PES program allows inferences to be made about the quantification and financial valuation of hydrological benefits of the potential storage increase and current water price. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Hydrological services; Land use change; SCS-CN method; USLE model; Water erosion","feasibility study; hydrology; land cover; land use change; numerical model; price dynamics; runoff; soil conservation; soil erosion; soil management; water budget; water management; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879785507

The area is virtually free of deforestation and blessed with abundant fishery resources. It is widely regarded to be the best freshwater fishing location in the world and until recently was regarded as one of the global centers of the aquarium fish trade. Unfortunately, a variety of factors have kept the human population of this immense region from benefiting from these abundant natural resources. This paper outlines a path towards sustainable development of these resources that we developed in conjunction with the government of Barcelos, fishermen's cooperatives, and indigenous associations. The paper illustrates how a payment for environmental services can jump start sustainable development in a pristine area and illustrate some of the factors that can impede such a system. Most discussion of payment for environmental services focuses on how such a payment can prevent deterioration of an area under current threat. The goal is to improve the quality of life of the citizens of the area in a way that eliminates future potential threats to the ecological integrity of the complex aquatic/terrestrial ecosystem. In addition to the development of human capital, a fishery and ecotourism management plan is developed that uses the revenue from the environmental tax to solve infrastructure, human capital and social capital needs. Although the official program of payment for environmental services was halted for local political reasons, the authors are in the process of establishing a voluntary program of payment for environmental services which will accomplish the same objectives.

The model favors application to headwater catchments where clean water production is expected. However, the frequent invasion of these areas with intensive agriculture and livestock production systems affects water quality threatening the use of this resource, namely as drinking water. The proposed Agriculture for Clean Water Yield (ACWY) model reconciles agriculture with clean water production through the incentive approach, giving the farmers a financial compensation if they are willing to replace intensive by sustainable agriculture and livestock production systems, namely agro-forestry systems. The reconciliation through the incentive approach is justified because clean water and food are both vital goods for human survival. The compensation rises as function of increasing catchment water yield capacity and conversion costs. For example, landowners receive more if land conversion occurs in slopping than undulated landscapes. The model applied to Fazenda Glória watershed, composed of 19 headwater catchments (96.7 ha on average), proposed financial incentives in the range 218.73–576.5 US$/ha/year depending on the catchment's water yield capacity, which rise to 284.35–749.45 US$/ha/year if conversions occur in extreme vulnerable areas. The watershed, located in São Paulo state, Brazil, covers 18.4 km2 and is the source of drinking water to 70,000 people living in Jaboticabal city. Monitoring is essential to assess the performance of ACWY and adjust the compensation dynamically. For instance, noteworthy improvements in water yields and water quality or land conversions performed in short periods can expect the most generous compensation. Two concerns about implementing the model in Fazenda Glória rely on the lack of political will in spite of existing federal and state legal support, as well as on the financial sources to make the model a real project. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Agro-forestry sustainable production; Best management practices; Headwater catchments; Land conversion; Payment for ecosystem services; Water provision services","Catchments; Ecosystems; Finance; Forestry; Potable water; Sustainable development; Timber; Water quality; Watersheds; Agriculture productions; Agro-forestry sustainable production; Best Management Practise; Clean waters; Headwater catchment; Land conversion; Payments for ecosystem services; Water production; Water provision service; Water yield; Runoff; drinking water; water; agroforestry; catchment; drinking water; ecosystem service; headwater; resource management; sustainable development; water resource; agricultural worker; agriculture; agroforestry; Article; available water capacity; Brazil; catchment area (hydrology); cropland; economic incentive; harvest; human; livestock; priority journal; water monitoring; water quality; water supply; watershed; workman compensation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105691414

To reduce erosion in the watershed, a program of Payments for Environmental Services (PES) is being implemented, initially in a micro-watershed that has been identified as contributing disproportionately to sediment loads.

One notable example is the materialization of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) in Brazil, where a sustainable development discourse dominates national forest governance at the expense of a carbon commodification discourse. This research paper adopts a Foucauldian approach to plot the epistemological foundations of the market logics that still influence REDD+ institutionalization in Brazil to a large extent and thereby reproduce what we define as a ruptured dependence on nature. More specifically, we recognize ruptured dependence in the three building blocks of market instruments, namely singularization, monetary valuation and appropriation. Our analysis shows that REDD+ institutions have retained the singularization and monetary valuation of emission reductions, even though the appropriation processes have rejected the possibility of exchange and instead emphasized the national ownership of emission reductions. However, appropriation remains a highly politicized process that is sensitive to criticism and open to calls for alternative approaches that are closer to ruptured dependence. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Building blocks; Market instruments; PES; REDD+; Ruptured dependence","development discourse; economic instrument; emission control; environmental policy; sustainable development; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063520285

Consequently, there is a build-up of pressure for land use for agricultural production, creating the necessity of sacrificing areas previously occupied by the native land cover to create production areas. However, globally, the possibilities of agricultural frontier expansion are limited, and agricultural expansion activities conducted without adequate planning can accelerate the erosive processes that decrease the potential land production capability. In an attempt to attenuate environmental imbalances, payment for ecosystem services (PES) programmes have been created, highlighting the possibility of their being applied in the agricultural sector. This study developed a methodology for PES that follows the basic principles of the land use capability classification system proposed by the United States Department of Agriculture. However, the study aimed to make the classification process operational in a way that notes the conditions in which a rural property maintains its production capability without jeopardizing its environmental role. In this way, it is possible to evaluate whether a rural property is suitable to receive PES. To detail the steps for applying the methodology, a case study was conducted on a rural property in the town of Itabira, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. © 2018 British Society of Soil Science","food security; land capability; land use planning; Payment for ecosystem services; soil and water conservation; sustainable agriculture","agricultural production; alternative agriculture; ecological economics; ecosystem service; food security; human activity; land cover; land use change; land use planning; methodology; population growth; rural economy; soil conservation; water management; Brazil; Itabira; Minas Gerais",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054336844

Agroforestry Systems was the journal in which articles were most frequently published, and Cameroon and Indonesia the most frequently studied countries. The greatest number of authors came from the USA, and authors were most commonly affiliated with ICRAF. A limited collaboration between research groups in the tropical regions was identified. Anthropology and Social Sciences were the most frequent areas of research, especially in Africa. Latin America had more technical studies and more publications discussing payment for environmental services than the other regions. Based on the temporal analysis of the main terms in abstracts of the publications included, it was found that agriculture-related terms and terms related to the human component in the landscape were consistently prevalent in the literature relating reforestation and livelihoods throughout time. Agroforestry systems were especially important in small-scale reforestation and livelihoods. Trends, biases and gaps were discussed.

Up-to-date carbon emission estimates covering the long-term development of such frontiers depend on the availability of high spatial–temporal resolution data. In this paper, we provide a detailed assessment of carbon losses from deforestation and potential forest degradation from fragmentation for one expanding frontier in the Brazilian Amazon. We focused on one of the Amazonia’s hot-spots of forest loss, the BR-163 highway that connects the high productivity agricultural landscapes in Mato Grosso with the exporting harbors of the Amazon. We used multi-decadal (1984–2012) Landsat-based time series on forested and non-forested area in combination with a carbon book-keeping model. We show a 36% reduction in 1984s biomass carbon stocks, which led to the emission of 611.5 TgCO2 between 1985 and 1998 (43.6 TgCO2 year−1) and 959.8 TgCO2 over 1999–2012 (68.5 TgCO2 year−1). Overall, fragmentation-related carbon losses represented 1.88% of total emissions by 2012, with an increasing relevance since 2004. We compared the Brazilian Space Agency deforestation assessment (PRODES) with our data and found that small deforestation polygons not captured by PRODES had increasing importance on estimated deforestation carbon losses since 2000. The comparative analysis improved the understanding of data-source-related uncertainties on carbon estimates and indicated disagreement areas between datasets that could be subject of future research. Furthermore, spatially explicit, annual deforestation and emission estimates like the ones derived from this study are important for setting regional baselines for REDD+ or similar payment for ecosystem services frameworks. © 2016, The Author(s).","Carbon book-keeping; Dataset uncertainty; Deforestation; Edge effects; Forest degradation; INPE-EM; Landsat",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996837273

Many of the PES programs are based on water erosion control and the corresponding environmental and economic benefits generated in the basins where they are implemented. The main objective of this study was to show how erosion susceptibility models can support PES programs. Materials and methods: The application of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) in the Sarandi Experimental River Basin (32.7 km2), located in the Federal District, Brazil, was used as a study case. Then a scheme for organizing knowledge about ecosystem services related to erosion control and water resources was performed. Considering the generated scheme, the USLE results, the land use map, and the water use in the region, we evaluated how erosion modeling could support PES programs. Results and discussion: The results show that a large part of the study basin (90%) presents ""low"" susceptibility to erosion, which is significant in terms of the use and conservation of ecosystem services, as well as being a limitation regarding the need for the implantation of PES programs for erosion control. Incentives for maintaining the natural vegetation in areas with higher erosion susceptibility have the greatest potential to justify PES programs in the study basin, and the sanitation company is the potential payer for erosion control in the Sarandi River Basin.

This work aims to present the analysis of the feasibility of the proposal for the implementation of a Payment for Environmental Services (PES) project for flood control. It is related to the recovery and conservation of areas of environmental interest in a hydrographic basin and considering the river channel as a reference and its buffer areas. For the implementation of a PES project aiming at the reduction of floods downstream through the recovery of riparian forests, including their subsequent maintenance, this work proposes a flowchart of the applicable steps, develops a formulation for the definition of payment for the service, and defines a set of measures necessary for its management. Through a case study, it was possible to simulate different scenarios for different recurrence time (RT) in the study area, and thus assess the damage caused by these different events. The innovation of this work comes from the use of PES for the control of floods, with the use of an integral formula to calculate the costs of PES and to evaluate the expected damages. The application of the Poisson distribution was used to estimate the losses for different RT events expected in 50 years, estimating the losses overtime for the scenario with the implementation of the PES project and without it. The damage when reduced or avoided becomes a useful resource for the establishment of other public policies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Avoided losses, riverside areas; Economic instruments; River basin; Urban planning","Catchments; Deforestation; Floods; Land use; Poisson distribution; Rivers; Urban growth; Avoided loss, riverside area; Control analysis; Control methods; Economic instruments; Economic viability; Flood plains; Land use pattern; Payment for environmental services; Recurrence time; River basins; Flood control; economic instrument; flood control; floodplain; implementation process; river basin; urban development; urban planning; Article; city planning; decision making; ecosystem restoration; environmental economics; environmental planning; environmental policy; environmental protection; feasibility study; fee; flooding; forest management; geography; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102058450

Thus, payment for ecosystem services is an essential instrument to promote forest restoration in agricultural watersheds. However, funds are limited and must be well planned to ensure water resources conservation and water ecosystem services improvement. In this context, our study aimed to identify priority areas for forest restoration, based on water ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. For this, we have developed a decision-making support model for agricultural watersheds (in the Atlantic Forest region), based on mixed approaches, that were multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and Participatory Technique. The model will help decision-makers and stakeholders to set priorities for payment for ecosystem services programs implementation. So, we evaluate its application in watersheds with different forest cover patterns to check if it can be applied to different landscape patterns. The base of the model was the following criteria, that were produced with high-resolution data and ranking in the Participatory Technique context, considering their importance for the study: proximity to spring, slope, soil erodibility, topographic index, and land-use/land-cover (LULC). The criteria were aggregated by the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) method (an MCE method). The priorities maps showed areas classified as high priority near the rivers (at most 200 m far from rivers), on the greatest slopes (>40%), on soils associated with high potential of erosion, and predominantly in agriculture lands. However, this class presented more percentage of the area associated with native forest in the forested watershed (native forest covers 55% of its area) than in the watershed non-forested (native forest covers 25%). Another important point of the final maps was a high percentage of areas associated with the medium class, which is a characteristic of the WLC method. Thus, areas classified as high and medium priority was defined as targets for forest restoration in the watersheds. We can conclude that for small watersheds, the MCE method, with high-resolution data, supports an appropriate prioritization of areas for forest restoration, aiming at the improvement of water ecosystem services. This way, our model can be applied to various payments for ecosystem services schemes in agricultural landscapes worldwide. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Atlantic forest; Forest restoration; Participatory analysis; Payment for ecosystem services; Watershed management; Weighted linear combination method","drinking water; ecosystem service; environmental restoration; forest cover; multicriteria analysis; prioritization; watershed; Atlantic Forest; water; agriculture; ecosystem; environmental protection; forest; river; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Rivers; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100509893

Monitoring of these watersheds has been a focus of intensive study for the past 20 years and although this work has greatly increased our understanffng, considerable gaps still remain in our ability to provide adequate recommendations for land management and associated public policies. In this study we present a summary of finffngs from these previous results. For small properties, the use of fire to prepare land for cultivation remains controversial, while in large properties, forest conversion to pasture and/or crop production has had a meaningful and adverse effect on water quality. Riparian forest conservation can make a significant fffference in reducing impacts of land-use change. Secondary vegetation can also play an important role in mitigating these impacts. New types of sustainable agricultural production systems, together with incentives such as payments for ecosystem service can also contribute. Continued monitoring of these changes, together with robust sustainable development plans, can help to preserve forest while still addressing the social and economic needs of Amazonian riverine inhabitants. © 2020 by the authors.","Biogeochemistry; Deforestation; Land management; Land-use change; Public policies; Water resources; Watersheds","Agricultural robots; Biogeochemistry; Conservation; Deforestation; Economics; Ecosystems; Land use; Public policy; Water quality; Water resources; Watersheds; Agricultural impacts; Brazilian Amazon; Forest conversion; Land managements; Land-use change; Payments for ecosystem services; Secondary vegetation; Sustainable agricultural; Cultivation; agricultural production; biogeochemical cycle; crop production; cultivation; deforestation; ecosystem service; land management; social policy; sustainable development; water resource; watershed; Brazil; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082673478

The main objective is to analyze the offer of ecosystem services in the Ibirapuitã Environmental Protection Area (EPA), regarding the beef cattle production and sheep farming in the natural grassland. A case study with nine producers of the Association, considered as an analysis unit, was conducted in 2017 through semi-structured interviews. According to the producers, the preservation of animal production was valid, as they believed that it can provide welfare for their families and the remaining population. The respondents mentioned that, in the past, the tradition of producing beef cattle and sheep was very strong in the region, but nowadays, besides the tradition, they produce for profit, to be able to remain in rural areas. Beef cattle through the ecosystem supply service providers food for the population through meat production and sheep farming through meat and wool. Although the main theme of the research is directly related to the provisioning services, mainly focusing on beef cattle in the natural grassland, the cultural ecosystem services were widely cited during the research. The interviewers strongly highlighted the preservation of the traditional activities, conducted since the early days of occupation of the territory of Rio Grande do Sul, as well as the issues related to the preservation of the environment in which they live, the solidarity between the producers, and the natural grassland maintenance. Moreover, the observed landscapes indicated that the maintenance of rural agroecosystems in the region was preserved, thus putting even more emphasis on the range of ecosystem regulatory services. © 2020 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

There are distinct strategies that aim to value services provided by ecosystems, combining conservation to the access of environmental services provided by biodiversity. In this context, there are the Payments for Environmental Services (PES). Throughout the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest (MOF), the plant species Araucaria angustifolia, known as Pinheiro-do-Paraná, is as threatened as the MOF ecosystem itself. Consequently, PES programs appear as an alternative tool to the main strategies for the preservation and conservation of biodiversity. In order to evaluate the PES programs created at the MOF that contribute to the species' conservation, we evaluated four PES projects in southern Brazil: ""Desmatamento Evitado"", ""Araucária+"", ""Corredor Ecológico Chapecó"" and ""Estrada com Araucárias"", all of them distributed in Paraná and Santa Catarina states. The basis for the programs' selection was a literature review. Once we selected them, we identifed the indicators and topologies of each one, as well as an index indicating positive and negative points between the selected PES programs. The results showed that the selected PES have broad objectives, which value diferently the indicators of additionality, permanence, transaction, but showed little evidence to the spillover indicator. The mostly contemplated typologies are support and regulation. Cultural services typology could be contemplated more frequently, for instance. Finally, by analyzing these four programs, despite few indicators and typologies that involve a PES, there are diferent possibilities that align conservation and valuation of biodiversity positively, since the programs have diferent methodologies, scopes, and objectives in general. © 2019 Universidade Federal do Parana.

Environmental valuation is considered an important methodological tool to subsidize decision-making for the natural resources use. This study aimed to quantify the area of PPA's in springs and margins of water courses, before and after the change in the Forest Code; and to estimate the economic value of priorities PPA's. The study was conducted in the Passaúna River Watershed, located in the city of Curitiba. The GIS data were made available by the Water Institute of Paraná State. The ""opportunity cost"" method was used for economic valuation combined with priorities areas. Using the limits of the new Forest Code (2012) there may be a reduction of 1,077.1 ha in PPA's around river banks, springs and lakes. The agricultural area is predominant, representing 46.11% of the total area. It was identified 204.9 and 872.2 hectares areas as high and low priority areas respectively. The estimated economic value for the maintenance of these areas is R$ 945.00 ha/year. It is concluded that the presented map and the environmental valuation are an important reference for decision-making by public managers, as well for the public policies implementation, as payment for ecosystem services, which reward and encourage rural producers to conserve forest areas with important environmental functions. © 2018 Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

A case study is used in the region of the La Guajira Peninsula (Colombia), with a focus on the EHS of water flow regulation. The proposed methodology hypothesizes that EHS that have not been objectively demonstrated lead to failures in the implementation of guidelines of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES). Following this idea, we have tried to understand and quantify the relationship between vegetation coverage and streamflow regulation. To prove this relationship and the existence of the mentioned EHS in the La Guajira Ecosystem, we determined land cover changes from 2000 to 2013 using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and we also quantified the streamflow regulation using hydrological and meteorological time series in the study area. The analysis methods used were insufficient to determine the influence of vegetation on hydric regulation EHS; nevertheless, a greater influence of morphometry was observed in medium-and large-sized basins. Another important finding shows the relevance of selecting an adequate spatial and time resolution when quantifying water flow regulation services and its relationship with land cover characteristics. In this way, this exercise shows the complexity of quantifying EHS. Furthermore, we highlight some aspects that must be taken into account to properly quantify streamflow regulation due to vegetation coverage. © 2017, Institute for Environmental Research in Hydrographic Basins (IPABHi).

The Human Development Index (HDI) and Gini Index (GI) values were compared between municipalities with and without CAs using the non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. The correlations between the HDI and GI of each municipality and its areas occupied by CAs were analyzed using the non-parametric Spearman correlation test. A total of 560 CAs were identified in the 853 municipalities of the state. The HDI values of municipalities with CAs were not significantly different from those of other areas, but significant differences were found in the GI values, which were higher in municipalities with CAs. No significant correlations were found between the HDI of municipalities and their areas occupied by CAs. However, significant correlations were found between the GI and areas occupied by CAs, suggesting that the CAs are associated with greater socioeconomic inequalities.

We also present the technical, methodological, and cost-benefit studies behind the proposed framework. For instance, we found that cattle raising profitability in Apuí offers an opportunity for implementing such a pilot project. The framework proposed by the project engage stakeholders and bind together interests of governmental, non-governmental, and local civilian institutions in an agreement mechanism of mutual commitments. We highlight the related challenges and caveats, and the steps identified to overcome these hurdles.

However, to use these instruments, it is necessary to understand the economic value of the environment. The environmental resources and services values can be estimated by the knowledge of the society willingness to pay (WTP) for their preservation. Inside of this perspective, a socioeconomic and environmental diagnosis was accomplished on the Xopotó River Watershed. The diagnosis aimed at estimating the environmental value of 40 farms distributed in four counties of this watershed. Through the adaptation of the Willingness to Pay (WTP) methodology, the Willingness to Receive (WTR) of each farmer to immobilize areas in their farms to ensure the provision of environmental services was estimated. The Xopotó River Watershed is undergoing great pressures that endanger the promotion of environmental services. The value of the WTR revealed by the farmers to maintain preserved areas of important environmental functions in their farms corresponds, on average, to R$160,00.(ha.year)-1. This value is closed to that one which is already practiced in some payment for environmental services initiatives in Brazil. This value serve as reference for implementation of public policies, which would recognize the farmers as environmental services producers, motivating them to continue exercising these services for the human survival.","Environmental compensation; Environmental economy; Environmental services","agricultural land; conservation management; environmental economics; environmental values; estimation method; immobilization; implementation process; policy making; resource use; socioeconomic conditions; watershed; willingness to pay; Madagascar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952298892

However, natural regeneration potential may vary within the landscape, mainly due to its historical context. In this work, we use spatially explicit restoration scenarios to explore how and where, within a given region, multiple restoration commitments could be combined to achieve cost-effectiveness outcomes. Our goal is to facilitate the elaboration of forest restoration plans at the regional level, taking into consideration the costs for active and passive restoration methods. The approach includes (1) a statistical analysis to estimate the natural regeneration potential for a given area based on alternative sets of biophysical, land cover, and/or socioeconomic factors and (2) the use of a land change allocation model to explore the cost-effectiveness of combining multiple restoration commitments in a given area through alternative scenarios. We test our approach in a strategic region in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome, the Paraiba Valley in São Paulo State. Using the available data for 2011, calibrated for 2015, we build alternative scenarios for allocating natural regeneration until 2025. Our models indicate that the natural regeneration potential of the region is actually very low, and the cost-effectiveness outcomes are similar for all scenarios. We believe our approach can be used to support the regional-level decision-making about the implementation of multiple commitments aiming at the same target area. It can also be combined with other approaches for more refined analysis (e.g., optimization models). © 2021, The Author(s).","Cost-effectiveness; Ecological forest restoration; Land change models; Payments for environmental services; Restoration methods; Restoration planning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108448160

A multi-dimensional perspective, using the Search, Appraisal, Synthesis, Analysis (SALSA) framework was followed to explore, describe and determine the PES effect in scientific articles indexed in Scopus, SciELO and Redalyc databases. We applied the qualitative method to describe the PES schemes, principal trends and general tendencies in studies reported in 72 pre-selected publications. The qualitative analysis included methodological steps, such as search, article screening, coding, data extraction, analysis and synthesis. Our review reveals that PES schemes in Latin America are primarily supported by public funds that are implemented at national scale with an average timescale of five years. The schemes are largely oriented toward conservation goals, hydrological modality and forestry systems, and are dominated by the traditional disciplinary approaches. The predominant effects of the schemes are mainly related to positive weak changes on environmental, social and economic aspects. In addition, collaboration among co-authors involved the USA, Mexico, Spain, Brazil, Costa Rica and the UK (including an important percentage of publications with authors from non-LA countries), with incipient LA intercountry co-workers. Results from this systematic review highlight issues that represent future challenges for studies of PES effects and open further dialog to improve the effectiveness of compensation programs to reduce the replication of undesirable impacts, lack of additionality, and the pursuit of perverse incentives regarding the complexity of social-ecological systems. © 2021","Evidence synthesis; PES effects; SALSA framework; Semantic network analysis; State of art",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102656778

Considering the sampling universe of 68 Brazilian hydrological PES initiatives, we observed: higher concentration of programs in the South and Southeast, with a tendency to expand them to other Brazilian regions, especially the Midwest; the first initiatives of hydrological PES in Brazil adopted the payment of a fixed value, without considering the biotic quality of the rural properties, a pattern which was gradually replaced by the calculation of the opportunity cost of land and the inclusion of physical-environmental indicators and socioeconomic factors in the valuation methodologies. The study allows to conclude that, in the last decade, there has been a tendency for hydrological PES programs to adopt methodologies with an interdisciplinary and systemic approach to assess the provision of environmental services. © 2021 Associação Brasileira de Engenharia Sanitária e Ambiental Este é um artigo de acesso aberto distribuído nos termos de licença Creative Commons.","Ecosystem services; Environmental valuation; Management of water resources",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106724388

A major challenge is to understand and potentially mitigate the consequences of these changes, for the capacity of forests to deliver essential environmental services to rural areas. Here, we focus on unraveling the mechanisms underpinning spatial variation in forest leaf area index. Forest leaf area index can be used as an environmental indicator that controls key forest functions underlying environmental services and is also expected to respond to land use change. Specifically, we use Structural Equation Modelling to determine the direct and indirect pathways that link environmental drivers to canopy leaf area index (LAI) variation across forest types in the Atlantic Forest in Southern Brazil. We sampled 240 sample units (each 4000 m2), from a systematic and permanent forest inventory set which covers the State of Santa Catarina in a 10 km × 10 km grid, using hemispherical photographs. Environmental variables were extracted for each sample unit, including climatic and topographic data as well as indicators of anthropogenic pressure. Our results showed that forest types differed in their leaf area index (but not all of them) and that forest canopies show complex responses to environmental drivers, encompassing direct and indirect pathways. A major pathway was the positive effect of ‘Distance to city’ on the ‘Percentage of cropland in the matrix’. This led to a decline in the distance of the sample unit to the forest edge, indirectly reducing LAI, presumably because of elevated tree mortality at the forest edge. ‘Terrain steepness’ and ‘Rainfall in the driest month’ independently affected the ‘Percentage of cropland in the matrix’ and the ‘Distance to forest edge’. Halting forest fragmentation and increasing fragment size by landscape planning will mitigate these anthropogenic LAI declines. This can be achieved with a combination of legal and market mechanisms, like enforcement of the Brazilian Forest Act regulation on buffer zones around water bodies and steep slopes, landscape planning, and payment for environmental services to compensate the farmers for maintaining forest cover on otherwise productive land. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Hemispherical photograph; Leaf area index; National forest inventory; Structural equation model","Biodiversity; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Land use; Tropics; Anthropogenic pressures; Environmental indicators; Environmental services; Environmental variables; Hemispherical photographs; Payment for environmental services; Structural equation modelling; Subtropical Atlantic forests; Environmental regulations; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; forest cover; forest ecosystem; forest edge; forest inventory; fragmentation; landscape planning; leaf area index; mortality; rural area; spatial variation; Biodiversity; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Environmental Regulations; Land Use; Tropics; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Santa Catarina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089105089

Historically, the assessment of stream flow discharge in Brazilian watersheds was relevant for dam dimensioning, flood control projects and irrigation systems. Nowadays, it plays an important role in the creation of sustainable management plans at the catchment scale aimed to help in establishing legal policies on water resources management and water security laws, namely, those related to the payment for environmental services related to clean water production. Headwater catchments are preferential targets of these policies and laws for their water quality. The general objective of this study was to evaluate water availability in first-order sub-basins of a Brazilian headwater catchment. The specific objectives were: (1) to assess the stream flow discharge of first-order headwater sub-basins and rank them accordingly; (2) to analyze the feasibility of payment for environmental services related to water production in these sub-basins. The discharge flow measurements were conducted during five years (2012 to 2016), in headwaters in a watershed on the São Domingos River at the Turvo/Grande Watershed, represented as the 4th-largest hydrographic unit for water resources management—UGRHI-15 in São Paulo State, Brazil. A doppler velocity technology was used to remotely measure open-channel flow and to collect the data. The discharge values were obtained on periodic measurements, at the beginning of each month. The results were subject to descriptive statistics that analyzed the temporal and spatial data related to sub-basins morphometric characteristics. The discharge flows showed space–time variations in magnitude between studied headwater sub-basins on water availability, assessed based on average net discharges. The set of ecological processes supported by forests are fundamental in controlling and recharging aquifers and preserving the volume of water in headwater in each sub-basin. The upstream inflows influence downstream sub-basins. To avoid scarcity, the headwater rivers located in the upstream sub-basins must not consider basin area as a single and homogeneous unit, because that may be the source of water conflicts. Understanding this relationship in response to conservationist practices installed uphill influenced by anthropic actions is crucial for water security assessment. The headwaters should be considered a great potential for ecosystem services, with respect to the “provider-receiver” principle, in the context of payments for environmental services (PES). © 2020 by the authors.

The projects from this program share the same goal: to disseminate the use of PES as a tool for land management in watersheds. Contemplating 11 municipalities, including 84 landowners, conserving 718.63 ha and restoring 188.58 ha, this program was concluded in April 2020. Reviewing its historical and contextualizing features, we have observed that the outcomes from this program extend beyond these numbers. Here, we propose an evaluation methodology comparing the efficiency, performance, and impact of the PES projects. Based on new indicators that are easy to measure, we have identified key elements that have asymmetrically affected the projects. The complexity of the project scope and the execution of high-cost, and risky interventions on rural properties, have resulted in expensive projects with little tangible outputs. Our results support the upgrade of public policy for investment in ecosystem services by CEIVAP in the Paraíba do Sul watershed. In addition, our results can be more successful by improving the decision-making processes for similar projects in other watersheds. © 2020 by the authors.","Nature-based solutions; River basin planning; Water governance; Water management indicators","Decision making; Ecosystems; Water resources; Brazilian Atlantic forests; Decision making process; Ecosystem services; Environmental benefits; Evaluation methodologies; Land managements; Payments for ecosystem services (PES); Program outcomes; Watersheds; cost-benefit analysis; decision making; ecosystem service; investment incentive; land management; landownership; local government; watershed; Atlantic Forest; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090983269

A choice experiment of 189 farmers in the Cantareira region – the drinking water source for over nine million people in the São Paulo metropolitan area – suggests that existing PES contract incentives are unlikely to spur enrollment by landowners with small properties and high dependence on agricultural income. This group is unlikely to restore forest without compensation, and survey responses indicate they need a much higher payment than current payment structures provide. Our results also provide support for the inclusion of in-kind incentives that increase agricultural productivity as a means to encourage participation.

This study aimed to analyze the origin of the sediments in the Posses catchment, municipality of Extrema, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, throughout the fingerprinting technique and portable X-ray fluorescence. Samples from soils under agriculture, pasture, and roads; and from the subsoil of theses land uses were taken in a widespread and representative manner from the entire Posses catchment. Lag deposits and river bed sediment samples were collected downstream from the catchment outlet. A total of 45 geochemical elements were analyzed in the samples by a portable X-ray fluorescence device (pXRF). The outlier test, Kruskal-Wallis test, multivariate discriminant analysis, and a mixing model were used to estimate the contribution of each source in relation to the sediments that arrive at the mouth of the catchment. The elements selected as geochemical tracers were Sr, Al2O3, Ba, Rb, Ti, Fe, and Zn, which combined correctly discriminated 81 % of the sediment sources. The largest and smallest proportion of sediment from the Posses catchment outlet comes from rural roads and agriculture, respectively. The contribution of the subsoil was higher for lag deposits or lower for river bed sediments, than the pasture. There was a low degree of uncertainty (&lt;8 %) for predictions made by the model employed. The types of use, selected as potential sediment sources in the Posses catchment, are adequately discriminated through the geochemical tracers quantified through the pXRF. The fingerprinting technique estimates that the contributions to outlet sediments are dominated by rural roads, following by subsoil or pasture (depending on the type of sediment evaluated) and by agriculture. The sediment sampling strategies used in this study provided similar results for the period studied.

This makes them vital allies to outside organizations seeking to support conservation and development initiatives. However, rural communities also have priorities and needs that may not align with the goals of conservation and development projects. This makes effective engagement of communities by outside organizations an important challenge. When rural communities lose traditional livelihood options, they prioritize economic benefits as a condition for participating in projects, and they exhibit “project fatigue” when many projects are imposed on their time. We reflect on our experience in seeking to align the goals of a conservation and development project with community priorities in the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve in Acre, Brazil. Our project featured capacity building for monitoring forest health to foster participation in payments for ecosystem services programs. Although we pursued prior consultations and designed participatory activities, and although we combined knowledge transmission with skills training, participation declined. That prompted our team to consult with community members, which generated important insights about expectations of immediate economic remuneration, community political cultures, communicative practices, and differences among local constituencies. These insights motivated adaptation of our practices via several strategies, such as focusing on young adults and holding workshops as part of community assemblies, which aligned project goals with the priorities of community members to improve project outcomes. © 2020 by the author(s).

Payment for environmental services (PES) is one of the several strategies that have been developed and implemented in order to mitigate this conflict. This study aimed to evaluate whether PES could smooth the “parks and people” conflict through the analysis of five case studies from different regions and social-environmental contexts. The results have shown that PES may contribute effectively towards conflict resolution, although it was not the main objective. However, the PES results differed between cases due to attributes such as local environmental conditions, local activities and involvement capacity of both the population and local government. Some characteristics must be considered in order to have efficient results, both in biodiversity and environmental services conservation, and in the development of populations involved towards maintaining PES continuity. It is necessary to consider PES joint strategies to improve the process efficiency from diagnoses to decision-making. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia","Ecosystem services; National park; Nature conservation; Protected areas; Socio-environmental conflict","Behavioral research; Biodiversity; Conservation; Decision making; Developing countries; Ecosystems; Ecosystem services; Environmental conditions; Environmental conflict; Environmental contexts; Environmental services; National parks; Payment for environmental services; Protected areas; Environmental protection; biodiversity; decision making; ecosystem service; national park; nature-society relations; park design; protected area; social conflict; Biodiversity; Capacity; Conservation; Decision Making; Developing Countries; Ecosystems; Resolution; Services",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079090984

Problems related to multiple uses of water resources, watershed revitalization and urban river recovery have placed new challenges on society and require innovative solutions. Proposed solutions, such as payment for ecosystem services (PES), aim to encourage people to adopt actions to solve specific issues in exchange for economic incentives. These solutions have limitations related to continuity of actions after the economic incentives cease. Thus, the main goal of this paper is to introduce and discuss a proposal to manage the Jundiai River Watershed that includes the adoption of a complementary currency created with blockchain technology, the Aqua. The main purposes of this cryptocurrency arethe recovery of riparian forests in rural zones and environmental actions in urban areas. The cryptocurrency Aqua would act as a medium of exchange and circulate only within the network of establishments that accept it. Seeking to avoid the negative consequences of speculative actions, we recommend the Aqua is not convertible into Reais or other cryptocurrencies. © 2019 Instituto de Estudos Avancados da Universidade de Sao Paulo.","Blockchain technology; Cryptocurrency; Delegated proof of stake consensus mechanism (DPoS); Payment for Ecosystem Services (PSA)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065660381

The case of carbon PES programs is instructive: land cover estimates are crucial for environmental monitoring efforts, but they require a consistent estimation method. Such consistency is however likely to be affected by climatic variability such as that seen during severe droughts. This raises questions as to whether distinct methodologies for land cover monitoring yield the same estimates of land- cover change over time in the presence of climatic variability. This study compares deforestation estimates from four methodologies during a normal year (2008) with those during a period of extreme drought (2010) in the Madre de Dios region of Peru in the Southwestern Amazon. The four methodologies compared are the automated classification with CLASlite 2.2, Tasseled Cap classification with ERDAS Imagine 9.2, Bhattacharya classification with SPRING 5.1, and Spectral Angle Mapper classification with ENVI 4.7. The results show differences in the forest and non-forest estimates derived from using ERDAS and CLASlite compared with those from using the SPRING and ENVI. These findings have implications for forest monitoring efforts for PES programs such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) in the context of climate change. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Amazon; Climate variability; Forest monitoring; Land Use land cover change",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011269411

In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the conservation of its water springs and environmental compliance with the legislation of Permanent Preservation Areas (PPAs). A macroscopic diagnosis of the water springs was therefore made in the field in order to subsequently classify their condition. The assessment of environmental compliance with the PPAs was performed with the aid of RapidEye (2014) satellite images and the Quantum GIS 1.6 program. The results indicated that water quality stands out positively, while the land use and occupation of the springs areas showed negative results. No water spring is located in protected areas and only one was found on an agricultural farm; none had signs indicating its presence. Most of them show evidence of human disturbance, such as degradation of vegetation and garbage dumping. The evaluation of environmental compliance demonstrated that 30.7% of the PPAs lack adequate vegetative cover, and thus may potentially be included in an intervention program for recovery due to degradation. The profile analysis of the properties that have water springs indicated the predominance of lands without any commercial use that included recreational country houses. The work indicated some environmental and socioeconomic characteristics of the watershed that can support public policy for the conservation of water resources in the region, if considered in the establishment of a PSA program. © 2016, Institute for Environmental Research in Hydrographic Basins (IPABHi).

CA is now practiced worldwide on some 200 million hectares, important for mitigating climate change and ensuring food security. Its bedrock is Zero Tillage (ZT) with crop rotation and retention of crop residues. CA approaches Or-19 ganic Agriculture (OA) when coupled to biological control providing opportunity for OA to become truly sustainable. Ley Farming (LF) and agroforestry with ZT are important for carbon sequestration and land use intensification. Hidden cost: each ton of carbon immobilizes 83 kg of N, 29 kg of P, and 14 kg of S. Industry-backed Regenerative Agriculture (RA) variants have no scientific definition, but generally adopt CA. Sustainable, profitable, and compatible new technologies are emerging and CA needs to embrace them to present a holistic, sustainable package to the farmer. How? A single definition for agricultural sustainability via a multi-stakeholder world congress would standardize certification and de-confuse the market. RA describes exactly what CA does for soil health and all farmers need to unite around a new “Combined Regenerative Agriculture” (CRA) to lobby for adequate payments for environmental services. Expansion of CA is critical for world sustainability. Many gaps and constraints exist, especially for smallholders. © 2021 by the authors.

The methodology was based on the application of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological modelling to investigate flow simulations in current land use and in two future scenarios (forest and pasture). The performance of goodness-of-fit indicators in the calibration (NSE = 0.82, R2 = 0.85, PBIAS = 11.9% and RSR = 0.42) and validation (NSE = 0.70, R2 = 0.72, PBIAS = −4% and RSR = 0.55) was classified as good and very good, respectively. The model accurately reproduced the inter-annual distribution of rainfall. The spatial distribution of average annual surface flow, lateral flow, and groundwater flow were different between sub-basins. The future scenario on land use change to forest (FRSE) and pasture (PAST) differed during the year, with greater changes on rainy and dry seasons. FRSE increase of 64.5% in area led to decreased surface runoff, total runoff, and soil water; and increased lateral flow, groundwater, and evapotranspiration. The effect of the natural vegetation cover on soil moisture content is still unclear. The hydrological model indicated the main areas of optimal spatial water flow. Considering economic values, those areas should encourage the development of government policies based on incentive platforms that can improve environmental soil and water sustainability by establishing payment for environmental services (PES). © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we assess whether a positive change in soil and water conservation practices and riparian reforestation will affect the water availability and boost resilience in a Brazilian Cerrado basin under climate change scenarios. This study was developed in the Três Marias basin (50.600 km²) located in southeastern Brazil. First, we calibrated (1992–2005) and evaluated (2006–2012) the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Then, we created a land cover and land use change (LCLUC) scenario that considers improving soil and water conservation practices and the reforestation of riparian zones, following the recommendations of the Brazilian Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES). We also used the trend SSP2-4.5 and the fossil-based economy SSP5-8.5 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) climate scenarios data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) project for the period of 2015–2100. Along with a decrease of 5 %–15 % in precipitation in the projected period, an increase of 7 %–15 % in forest areas due to the LCLUC scenarios generated an increase in evapotranspiration values up to 38 %, resulting in a decrease of surface runoff and baseflow.

Turtles are important and publicly visible ecological indicator groups. We use continental turtles as flagship umbrella species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest hotspot to design a conservation strategy that incorporates taxonomic (TD), functional (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) for improved cost-effective outcomes. We first analyse the effectiveness of the current arrangement of protected areas (PAs) in safeguarding species by calculating the mean percentage overlap of each species range and the PAs network. We create three conservation models that differ in the amount of TD, FD and PD preserved. Each model defines a distinct plan (and cost) of paying landowners to participate in set-aside programs to preserve local habitats. We also analyse the performance of indicator species in representing TD, FD and PD gains and economic costs induced by payments for ecosystem services. The results show that species of continental turtles are not well conserved in the PAs. The spatial distribution of TD is highly correlated with that of FD and PD in the biome, with high values in the central region, in the extreme North, and in the South of the Atlantic Forest, due to the co-existence of the evolutionary lineages. We suggest a program for conservation planning to protect a threatened biodiversity hotspot, the ecosystem functions provided by flagship umbrella species, and its associated ecological and evolutionary values. Our findings are providing a representation of ecological and evolutionary values of continental turtles with annual economic benefits from environmental management tools. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Atlantic Forest; Biodiversity hotspot; Conservation priorities; Freshwater turtles; Protected areas; Tortoises","biodiversity; coexistence; conservation planning; economic analysis; environmental management; phylogenetics; taxonomy; Atlantic Forest; Indicator indicator; Testudines; Testudinidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113174596

Five mechanisms were selected for in-depth analysis using the Biofin methodological approach: ecological fiscal transfer, environmental reserve quotas, payments for environmental services, tourism concessions, and forest concessions. They can reduce the current financial gap for biodiversity conservation in the country. Ecological fiscal transfer, payments for environmental services, tourism, and forest concessions can generate approximately US$ 1 billion annually. The potential to generate revenues in environmental reserve quotas markets is big, but uncertainty is also very high, with estimates from US$ 1 to US$ 20 billion up to 2030. Most of these mechanisms aim to involve the private sector in conserving biodiversity and require an active role for the public sector, either through fiscal or regulatory instruments. There is a need to adapt the financial mechanism to the political and institutional context. In Brazil, weak public management capacity, institutional uncertainties, and political opposition to environmental policy are the main challenges for large-scale implementation of these instruments. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity finance; Biofin approach; Brazil; Environmental policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109001067

To quantify these benefits, we modeled the on-site (for rural landowners) and off-site benefits (for downstream water users relying on a large reservoir) of a pioneer municipal level PES project in Brazil established in 2005. We modeled the effects of landscape change on soil loss and sediment export from the Posses watershed using the InVEST model and a methodology that considered real aspects of the landscape and uncertainties in the input data and parameters, as well as economic factors. Results showed that a 3% increase in forest cover coupled with soil conservation practices led to a 0.9–3.5% and a 4.0–13.3% decrease in soil loss and sediment export, respectively. Part of this reduction was due to forest restoration and construction of micro-dams, which were built to improve infiltration close to unpaved roads. We show that PES projects enhance regulating services, providing benefits both onsite and to downstream reservoirs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Best management; Ecosystem services valuation; Erosion; Modeling ecosystem services; Payment for watershed services; Practices; Unpaved roads",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101342444

This work aims to identify areas that provide environmental services that present erosion control in the Municipal Environmental Protection Area (APA) of the Uberaba River, created to protect the public supply source in the municipality of Uberaba, MG. To do so, the sediment retention module of the software InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) is used, based on the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and created a hypothetical scenario, in which the Permanent Preservation Areas (PPAs) located within the EPA were reforested according to Law 12.651/2012. This allowed the comparison between the modeling results from the 2016 scenario with the hypothetical scenario. As a result, it was identified that the micro basins of the municipal EPA of the Uberaba River were classified with the following soil loses, medium (61%), medium-strong (27%), strong (2%), small to null (6%) and moderate (4%). According to the modelling of the InVEST software, the total sediments estimated for the micro basins that compose the municipal APA of the Uberaba River in 2016 was 2,620,062 tons/year and for the future scenario was 1,258,989 tons/year. This result indicates that the recovery of about 6 km2 of PPAs can reduce sediment generation by 48%. © 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Cartografia, Geodesia, Fotogrametria e Sensoriamento Remoto.

Socioeconomic and environmental diagnosis was performed using the Rapid Participatory Diagnosis technique. The total of 20 socioeconomic and environmental questionnaires were applied in the municipality, aiming to know in detail the local reality, raising potentialities and demands. The number of members of the 20 families that participated in the rural diagnosis was 72, of which 36 were men and 36 were women, with an average of 3.6 persons per family. Of the 20 rural properties that participated in the rural diagnosis, 35% have delimited RL areas and none of them has a management plan. The exploration of Legal Reserve occurs in 15% of the evaluated properties, being the production of firewood and cuttings the predominant activity. The average value of disposition receivable by rural producers was R$220.00 ha-1year-1, in which the producers who did not respond to this question were not considered.

In this context, the management-intensive grazing system (MIG) emerges as a viable alternative to conventional pastureland management. This study aims to analyze the Social-Ecological System (SES) transformation process of the dairy system in Santa Rosa de Lima, Southern Brazil, from conventional management to MIG. For the analysis, two different frameworks were combined: SES transformation process and the tripleloop learning frameworks. The analysis was based on a statistical analysis of interviews, conducted with dairy farmers. Results show that the dairy system in Santa Rosa de Lima is in the middle of a transformation process. During this phase, farmers have already reached single and, partially, double-loop learning. Among the elements needed to successfully move the transformation process forward, social learning stands out as indispensable, as well as financial capital. For this, payments for ecosystem services are suggested. © 2021","aprendizagem de triple-loop; aprendizaje de triple-loop; capital social; capital social; family dairy system; sistema de producción de leche familiar; sistema de produção de leite familiar; Sistema social-ecológico; Sistema social-ecológico; social capital; Social-ecological systems; transformation; triple-loop learning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118269774

It aims to evaluate the institutional robustness according to Ostrom's eight design principles of a Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) arrangement in the Miringuava River Basin, São José dos Pinhais, Brazil. Methodology: Using documentary analysis, and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders we analyze the applicability of Ostrom's eight design principles. Relevance: Our analysis and discussion shed light on social and institutional dimensions that might be insufficiently considered by the local public administration. Results: While our analysis showed that most principles apply in some measure to the case study, favoring the implementation of PES, there are divergences in terms of monitoring, conflict resolution, and sanctions that hint to particular problems of peri-urban commons management. We conclude that PES could become a problem of collective action, representing a mechanism to increase robustness of peri-urban institutions, which allowed us to interpret ES as a common. Theoretical contributions: The PES for forest areas, has run parallel to an agricultural transition to organic farming desired by environmental organizations but resisted by local farmers. While the conservation is justified by the reduction of water treatment costs and an increase in water availability, social implications of this choice turn out to be much more complex. Management contributions: There is a need for the creation of institutional arrangements that consider power imbalances and to expand the different forms of participation in the situated action arenas created for governance and management of a common. © 2021 Universidade Nove de Julho-UNINOVE.

Legislation, including resolutions and decrees, was analyzed, and an investigation of government data and academic works was provided. Although the Bolsa Verde program is not the sole public policy program to solve the environmental problems of the state, it is a strategic program since it stimulates the maintenance and recovering of native vegetation coverage. In fact, the Bolsa Verde may promote environmental and citizen conscience-awareness and improve the life style of the people concerned. Aims were compromised since there was no continuity, or rather, with only two maintenance modalities and nonpayment. The reactivation of the program is required and it is demanded that the state of Minas Gerais complies with the established clauses, particularly payment so that policies of conservation support are respected and valorized by society. © 2020 University Center of Maringa.

This study aimed to determine the land use capability and estimate the reduction of soil erosion, resulting from the adoption of better land use and management practices, for the Epaminondas stream watershed. Three representative farms were selected in the study area and split into homogeneous plots. A survey of the limiting factors of each plot was carried out, as well as physical and chemical analyzes of the soils. For each plot were undertaken a land use capability classification, conflict of use identification and a soil erosion percentual reduction estimate. The main limiting factors observed were shallow effective soil depth and textural gradient, which were responsible for 87.69% of the area being classified as class IV of land use capability. It was found that 53.42% of the agricultural area under study are overused, which characterizes conflict of use. The implementation of a payment for environmental services project, rewarding farmers for more adequate land use and replacement of conventional cultivation by conservationist systems, can provide a 59.74% reduction in erosion in these agricultural areas. In areas currently with vegetables and fallow, the adoption of the no-till vegetables production, combined with contour cropping and rotation with cover crops, in addition to pasture improvement, can promote a soil erosion reduction of approximately 51%. © 2020 Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP.

Flooding, as a stochastic phenomenon, can occur at any time and in any place, influenced by climatic factors, physical characteristics of the basin and mainly by human interference in the use and occupation of the land, which affects the type, quality and quantity of vegetation and increases soil impermeability. The aspects of regional urbanization led the State in 2012 to create the Metropolitan Region of Vale do Paraíba and the North Coast (RMVPLN), attracting large real estate investors. In the hydrographic basin of the river Una in the municipality of Taubaté, there has been an increase in flooding episodes and the possibility of worsening due to changes in land use and occupation. In this study, we sought to determine runoff as a function of changes in land use and occupation expressed by the variation in runoff coefficient (C) recommended by the Department of Water and Electricity of the State of São Paulo, (DAEE-SP) for licensing and intervention projects in water resources. The lower limits C = 0.35 and upper C = 0.70 were used admitting variations of 0.05 points in this interval to calculate the water flow (QE) and Intake Volumes (VE) in the basin from an intense precipitation of 100 years of recurrence time, from the use of the UEHARA Method (DAEE, 2006), to the control point located at the intersection of the Una River and the Presidente Eurico Gaspar Dutra Highway (BR 116-SP) and from this the Quota-Volume curve was drawn. The flood shares were obtained by hitting the reserve volumes found on the quota-volume curve. The current runoff coefficient of the basin is C = 0.35, which allows water to pass through the Dutra highway bridge. However, the modification of C = 0.50 due to the advance of urbanization, the level of flooding would reach 557.40 m. That exceeds the level of the lower base of the bridge (556.72 m) and, with C = 0.60, would reach the quota of 558.90 m, which would cover the asphalt surface of the highway. Given the real estate pressures in the metropolitan region, special care is recommended in the conservation, preservation and expansion of native forest vegetation with actions for Payments for Environmental Services (PSAs), de-silting actions of the main gutter and Una's tributaries, to contain the identified advance of urbanization in the basin, as well as the definition and installation of detention and retention basins. © 2020, Institute for Environmental Research in Hydrographic Basins (IPABHi).

In the last decade, Brazil experienced the implementation of Payment for Environmental Services (PES) programs to promote the restoration and conservation of natural resources, with recognized environmental gains. Considering the incipience of the use of this strategy as a municipal public policy, the present work was developed with the purpose of presenting the case study of the PES project in implantation in the municipality of São José dos Campos, in the Couves creek. The accomplishment of this research was subsidized by bibliographical revision, documental analysis and structured interviews, contemplating from its genesis, in 2010, until 2017. From the results, it was possible to verify that the municipal public agents invited efforts during the first five years to acquire knowledge, to establish regulatory means, to guarantee economic resources, to involve social agents affected by this policy, until it was possible to start the project. During this period the institutional arrangement was established, motivated by the viability of learning of the partner entities and the opportunity of contribution and sharing. The main gains from the implementation of the project are related to the increase of native vegetation and the improvement of water quality in the watershed that are used as source for local public supply. Among the challenges highlighted by public managers is the inexistence of resources: human, material, and financial dedicated to the initiative. Finally, it is highlighted that the learning generated by the project will serve the municipality for the continuity of the program and similar projects. © 2020 Associação Brasileira de Engenharia Sanitária e Ambiental.","Institutional arrangements; Payment for environmental services; São josé dos campos",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083954761

Traditionalism in production activity is the motive for the continuity of the Association in animal production. However, within the context of ecosystematic services, producers do not have a clear idea on how the maintenance of the production system may generate assets, even though it was evident that several regulatory, provision and cultural services were extant. The maintenance of animal production is valid for cattle breeders since they believe they provide well-being for their families and society.

Forms were applied in a sample of 78 families, in the community of Monte Alegre, located in the damping zone of the FLONA de Pacotuba, for the NTFPs ethnobotanical survey and the willingness to receive to maintain the forest cover. The mapping use of the soil Pacotuba FLONA and the damping zone were obtained through a Landsat image. The contingent valuation method was used using the forms to estimate the willingness to receive to maintain the forest cover. At FLONA de Pacotuba there is potential to produce NTFPs, with an offer mainly for medicinal and ecological purposes. The use of the soil demonstrates that the FLONA of Pacotuba presents a high percentage of forest cover, however the damping zone is with a high percentage of pasture and use of the soil Anthropic, with the payment for environmental services (PES) an alternative to increase the forest cover in the cushioning zone. The willingness to receive to maintain the forest cover of the owners in the damping zone and in the FLONA was greater than the PES of the state of Espírito Santo, which hinders the adoption of a payment program for environmental services. The PES of Espírito Santo, through the program Reflorestar, associated with the management of NTFPs, mainly medicinal and ecological, would be alternatives for income generation and preservation of the forest cover. © 2019 Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

Moreover, this study regards to what extent these projects contribute to recognize and value the multifunctionality of family farming. For such purpose, a case study of the following projects was carried out: ProdutorES de Água (Espírito Santo), Conservador das Águas (Minas Gerais) and Projeto Piloto (São Paulo). In these cases, project makers, managers and implementers were interviewed. The origins of these projects showed that they derived from the presence of three main elements technical, political interest and inancial support. The existence of these elements was made possible due to the work of diferent technical actors, politicians and partners. The interests that moved their actions were focused on political and institutional visibility, the environmental expertise accumulation and aimed at forest restoration, as well as being the main results achieved by the projects. Although the actors aimed to recognize, encourage and support farmers by and for environmental conservation, that was not the perspective that motivated actors. Thus, in addition to social, economic and cultural dimensions of the rural population being largely ignored, with the privilege of strictly environmental dimension; the latter also seems to have not been treated properly. Nevertheless, signiicant institutional results achieved allow us to explain the deep engagement of actors to undertake such projects. © 2018 Universidade Federal do Parana.

One of the anthropic actions that contribute tothis situation is the deforestation of the vegetation in Caatinga biome. Aiming to reconcile the protection of native vegetation and minimization of actions that contribute to the greenhouse effect, the instrument called Reduction of Deforestation and Forest Degradation (R. E. D. D) appears in the international scenario. The R. E. D. D is a type of Payment for Environmental Services (PES) based on the principle of Environmental Law called protector-receiver. Thus, the present studys ought to characterize the legal aspects for effectiveness in Pernambuco. For that, we analyzed the laws and publications (official andnon-official) related to the implementation of this model at the state level. The results demonstrate that it is possible to implement the instrument in Pernambuco, because in the State there is a legal framework created to implement the instrument ranging from the definition of responsibilities to the development of an institutional arrangement. © 2018 Editora Dom Helder.

In order to analyse the similarities and differences between REDD+ projects in Brazil that are using public funds or carbon markets as its financing mechanism, this study gathers project data from public access databases and applies statistical descriptive analysisand hypothesis testing to 18 variables that describe core project characteristics. Based on the analysis results for 89 pilot projects approved under the voluntary carbon market and the Amazon Fund, it is possible to identify that the projects under each category presents clear distinctions in characteristics related to participants, time periods, scope and monitoring reporting and verification. On the other hand, projects under both categories resort to both cash payments and non-monetary incentives such as institutional strengthening and infrastructure provision. The results pictures projects' efforts to adapt to the complexities of the forest sector and to the efficiency requirements necessary to achieve the expected REDD+ results. It is argued that a mixed financial mechanism should be adopted, in order to enable financing projects both under public funds and under carbon markets.","Economic instruments; Payments for environmental services; REDD+ finance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033217703
